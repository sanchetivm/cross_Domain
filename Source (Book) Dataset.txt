This was an outstanding read and very well written as can be expected for a Michael Crighton book. I think this was one of the better books I've read. The plot was well crafted and developed, and the subject matter is so thoroughly interesting and fascinating. Perhaps the most amazing aspect of the book is how Crighton writes about virtual reality and what eventually came to be Ipad devices technologies in such a prescient and eerily accurate way 25 years before these technologies were implemented. I never cease to be amazed by the genius who was Michael Crighton.
Thoroughly enjoyed reading this. Have been waiting for the release, and it's worth waiting for. Now eager to read the next volume from the series.
Unlike other princesses, Sita was made to study not just science and philosophy but also learned the martial arts and warfare combat. Later Sita was nurtured as the person who will play a crucial role in making India as the brightest nation again. And in her quest to complete her mission, she chose Ram as her partner. Sita ruled with pragmatism while Ram sticked to the laws. In sita, Ram found an "Ardhangini ", a life-partner who wishes to bring the glory to India.
Excellence writing once again by Amish, Sitamata ki jai Jai Shri Ram
amazing book just recieved it today morning and completed reading also the part 3 preview is amazing.the only thing I hate amish is as he always keep a me waiting .thnx my favourite author.awaiting it next 2 masterpieces.
Well you do slightly begin to lose interest after the 225th page. The only new chapter in the book after the 200th page which has not been adopted from scion of ikshvaku is the one about vali. Otherwise every thing is the same. Even the preview book of raavan does not build up much curiosity. I am excited about the book on Raavan because first time I will read a book with an insight in Raavans life. Sita is perfect only up till the 215th page. It deteriorates a bit but it is bearable.
Will update the review as I read the book but I don't think that the stars will come down from 5!
Sita: warrior of Mithila was good, but as someone rightly pointed out Samichi wasn't as intresting as Vashishta's in the first. also the kindle version doesn't have a sneak peek which i found a bit unfair. Other nthen that no complaints. Worth the wait
Looking forward to complete the book...i will love it as always loved Amish's writing.
This novel does not have the research that some of the other Crichton novels have, but it still has a lot of information on random things from the lawes of partial pressure to behavior analysis.
The book is just amazing. I completed it in one day. The part 3 coming in 2018, i am e agerly waiting for it. Waiting for 2 years was worthwhile
its all worth it. best book i have read so far perfect and precise visual effects described through words My speed of reading has increased due to high level of curiosity per chapter. i totally suggest this book for purchase !
Your agent canceled my pre order and now offering 50rs compensation... And advising to order again.. Thank you
How the reverred and worshipped have supported bad to become a hero someday. ? Greed to prove their intelligence ?
Had pre-ordered the book. Got it today. Too excited to start this new journey of Amish's imagination! The cover of the sneak preview book of the third book, "Raavan" looks amaziiiiinng!
Amish is the first author who has made me interested in Indian mythology.I really like the character of SIta portrayed is this book as here she has a much larger role than just being kidnapped by Raavan.The story,narration is really good and there is some light philosophy here and there which I absolute love.
Got it today. Hope it is as good as the first. :D Looking forward to read it.
The most gorgeous artwork in comic books. Contains the most extraordinary artwork of Alex Ross(Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman,  the Justice League, etc, even Hanna-Barbera!) A comics fan, I recieved this as a Christmas gift, and I read it again and again. A must-have for comic book fans.
I hate u Amazon..... Y only 5 stars...... It should have 10 stars.... Completely amazing book.

delivered on my birthday so happy..
This is only first part of revenge by shivgami. Story telling is good but there are lot of dark things mentioned, which are many time unnecessary I felt. Due to which this book should not be given to children. Otherwise good enough!
THis book was horrible.  If it was possible to rate it lower than one star i would have.  I am an avid reader and picked this book up after my mom had gotten it from a friend.  I read half of it, suffering from a headache the entire time, and then got to the part about the relationship the 13 year old boy had with a 33 year old man and i lit this book on fire.  One less copy in the world...don't waste your money.
delivered on my birthday so happy..
Awesome is the word to describe Amish' writing style. Blending mythology and fiction and making it app at real as if you have lived it. Fantastic.
good price and excellent delivery.
Scion of ikshvaku hit a major chord with me, a chord that stood apart from those hit by the shiva trilogy. Because the philosophy had a softer, more polished and a broader tone to it as opposed to the shaper and radical ones offered in the shiva trilogy. It was the injection of that serene mood more than the fantasized storyline that made it heartwarming. So naturally I had expected more of the same and much more from the second book of the series.
But I'm still going to pick up the third book with almost the same enthusiasm, as I like the idea of providing a backdoor to all the three main characters before assembling the final showdown, and I'm genuinely interested in how Amish will be handling the extremely strong and enigmatic character of ravana in the next book, and i think he has thrown in a major clue right at the end with regards to what will be coming between raavana and sita.
The best book, but Why there is no preview chapter of 3rd book Raavana of Rama Series in kindle version of eBook?
And please don't make us wait more than one year for your books. All the best!!!!
Plus there is a great shock which is going to be revealed in Raavan --- Orphan of Aryavarta and that is SITA IS THE BIOLOGICAL DAUGHTER OF RAAVAN!!!
This is book is the fiction story of the author, who does not know have the basic knowledge of Ramayan, his book is far from reality & he is misguiding about the role of Mother Sita. Extremely disappointed
The writing style and content just didn't flow. Wasn't real. I mean, in one section, she actually uses the term "bucko," as in, "Let me tell you something, bucko." What are we in "Happy Days?" Couldn't take the book seriously after that. Very bad.
I got the book for free luckily under Kindle promotions. Thanks Amazon and thanks Amish, for an enjoyable read.
Just came back from mahishmathi kingdom Waiting to enter again in next part
No party of society can be ignored. Army, business , the poor , the rich all are a part of society and if anyone one is ignored the society will fall.
Awesome Immersive Narration!! Every Scene of mahishmati and Actions mentioned in book seems floating in mind yet and would love to dive again in same world of words in 2nd Part. Only eliminating certain parts (which are to make novel crispier), the book really sets a platform for Bahubali 3.
They have nothing to lose.......But we should not be blind and assume that all poor are noble. Not everyone has the spirit to keep their character strong when their stomachs are angry. " said Sunaina while giving governing lessons to her daughter, Sita.
Did pre-order received today ,but Sita was missing got a preview copy of Ravan , now who kidnapped Sita this time when Ravan is wid me
Dr. Oz is an accomplished heart surgeon in the field of cardiac transplantation. He describes how he combines complementary medicine (e.g. hypnosis, reflexology, yoga, message, acupuncture. Etc) with orthodox Western medicine. There is an excellent forward by Dr Dean Ornish, and an interesting epilogue containing an overview of the complementary medicine techniques. The bulk of the book contains stories of patients Dr. Oz treated using this revolutionary way. I am a cardiologist, and I have a great interest in combining western medicine with complementary medicine, which is the reason I bought this book. However this book was a bit boring to read and was also a bit of a disappointment. Nevertheless, those interested in this new medicine, which I think will be the medicine of the new millennium, will want to read this book.
Pre-ordered the book and got it today. It doesn't matter though, but would be much appreciated if got on the same date as released. Super excited to get this book and the preview of 3rd book of the series. Packaging is good. One small disappointment was that it doesn't have "Bookmark". That's why 1 star less rating.
Awesome book, with shocking surprises and fascinating story.
Even though it is not a sequel of the frist book ,it is very good. Hoping the next book will not take 2 years

Wonderful narration, true feminism. Sita is not weak but she sometimes adjust to circumstances. As per her school name bhoomi, my guess is that she is the one who founded panchavati in Amish Shiva trilogy, bhumi Devi of naga's. It could be Amish way of traditional ramayana in which Rama and sita stay away once sita is pregnant and for good
It should not be surprising to find that there is a high load of suspense in trying to find fault, especially since the president of the company is backing the woman. Again, I recommend reading the book to get the full enjoyment of the twists and turns used by Meredith to win top dog position.
First of all i am a big fan of amish sir and i had read all the books he had written. I have received my order today and i am excited to read it. I know that this book is also going to be blockbuster.
I got the book for free luckily under Kindle promotions. Thanks Amazon and thanks Amish, for an enjoyable read.

However, grammar was the only weak part of the book. There were no grammatical errors this time around but the sentence formation was somewhat not upto the mark in certain sections.
I have picked up this book after reading the first book in the Ramachandra series. However I should say this book has not lived up to the benchmark set by the previous book. I love Amish's story telling technique and the way he builds the characters. When I read "Scion of Ikshvaku", I fell in love with Lakshman, Ram, Sita, Jatayu and others. When I read "Sita - Warrior of Mithila", I fell in love with Sunaina and fell for Jatayu again.
Even though it is not a sequel of the frist book ,it is very good. Hoping the next book will not take 2 years
Got only the complimentary book.
Amish Tripathi is indeed the best writer in India in the recent time.
After Naga series,Ram Chandra series too has proved the aforesaid.
Better than scion of ikshvaku, but still not that good
One thing that was super disappointing was "NO BOOKMARK". The only reason for the reduction of the rating!
All in theory only !!! In practical terms it was reading a story where you knew the start the end and the middle. And because Amish has already told you that he is writing the third book telling the same story again for the third time, so you even knew where the cliff hanger would be !!!

After seeking the blessings of Kanyakumari , Child Goddess, Janak and Sunaina came across a quaint scene. An injured vulture was surrounded by the pack of wolves and watching this unfair act of aggression, Sunaina spurred her horse to protect the bird and from some distance that the vulture was protecting a baby from the pack of the wolves.Goading her horses into a fierce gallop, Sunaina pressed forward to protect the child and the vulture. Sunaina's arrival scared the wolves to run away and with an approval from Janak, that abandoned child was named as Sita Ã§ause she was found in a furrow in Mother Earth and raised as the princess of Mithila.
Got it today. Hope it is as good as the first. :D Looking forward to read it.
Supplement of raavan was a surprise. Thanks
Worth a read. the narrative keeps you engrossed right uptill the climax, and also keeps you hooked on to the series.
It's one of the best books written by one of the best Indian authors
I wish i had the time spent reading this book back so i could use it for better purposes.  THis book wasted my life.
I like to use the Amazon reviews when purchasing books, especially alert for dissenting perceptions about higly rated items, which usually disuades me from a selection.  So I offer this review that seriously questions the popularity of this work - I found it smug, self-serving and self-indulgent, written by a person with little or no empathy, especially for the people he castigates. For example, his portrayal of the family therapist seems implausible and reaches for effect and panders to the "shrink" bashers of the world. This "play for effect" tone throughout the book was very distasteful to me.

When I want to read a historical fiction, I would want the contemporary influence to be as minimal as possible, if at all there is any it should be really subtle.
The book will be a nice collection for a book lover with the addition of the other two issues .The story is really nice and there was not a single page where I felt bored and I did not know when I came to the last part of the book and I am really eager what is in store in the next issues. It contains adult related writing so it is not for children.
In our urban society, there is a very common myth that poor are usually bad and avaricious people but Amish has bolted some logical words that will make readers understand that why and how, many times, a poor man is forced to be indulged in crime. "The Criminals among the rich are mostly driven by greed.
Completed three chapters, so good so far!!! And the little Sita in the second chapter looking so cuteðŸ˜˜ðŸ˜˜ 'sleeping like angel'
P.S: The next book will also be similar to this, told from the perspective of Raavan, who, if the clues are to be believed, is different from the stereotype evil tyrant (one can always hope).
I found that a little tiresome but maybe it's because it's now almost 20 years since the book came out and the jargon has become more popular. Even if you are not very tech-savvy, you can understand words such as CD-ROM, RAM, hypertext, wireless, etc. I imagine such technical explanation was helpful in the mid-nineties. But, overall, it's a great book.
THis book was horrible.  If it was possible to rate it lower than one star i would have.  I am an avid reader and picked this book up after my mom had gotten it from a friend.

One less copy in the world...don't waste your money.
All the broad philosophical themes are still there, the epic vision and imagination still exists but they don't work in harmony. They seem like individual set pieces that don't quite fill up the final storyboard, thus the attempted emotional mileage fell short most of the times and there are supposedly times when Amish dives more into the details, which is fine but you can't help but feel like he is pondering over these details to keep the pieces stitched together, in more straightforward terms, it felt draggy, especially the latter half of the book.
Rating it without reading. I know it's a masterpiece. Got my copy today.And already in love with the cover.
The RamChandra series is a prequel to Shiv trilogy so the reader already has an big idea of the revelations and ending of the series. To make matter even more Worse the current book starts of before Book1, overlaps all events to give the second protagonist point of view. May be to few this does not sound as bad as it is because they may argue that reading a story from a second point of view is also riveting.
Very good creativity by Amish, a lot of political wisdom thrown into the book. Awesome. Amish has yet again proved his mantle.
Waiting for Ram to come in to the scene, Curious!!!!
Well I like the first book of the Ram Chandra Series and waited a frickin more than 1 and a half year for the second part. So as soon as I saw that prr booking offer I just placed it. And boy I loved this book ( not as much as the first book). But now today on 2nd of June I saw that PayTm is selling the same book at way cheaper price, I'm confused whether it was good choice pre ordering a book or should have waited for few days and bought it from PayTm. Thoughts anyone?
Looking forward to complete the book...i will love it as always loved Amish's writing.

I must say "The read was much more than its worth"
Looking forward to complete the book...i will love it as always loved Amish's writing.
delivered on my birthday so happy..
The book was excellent in the first half but as it intersected with the 1st books , the anticipation and the suspense died for certain parts. The writing style is certainly much better than any of the previous ones and the time that took to write the book was certainly worth it.
If I order the book now...will I get the preview of the Raavan with this.....because have not pre ordered it...
That being said, this is another of the typical Amish books; the story is engaging, the characters are the usual mixed bunch (some pretty strong while the others forgettable) and the language is pretty straightforward. Go ahead if you like reading the novels of Amish and liked the first Ram Chandra novel.
Interesting world created by the author good work of fiction. Will be interesting to see how the author handles shambhok
Amazing book!!! But only one thing, in the past whenever i ordered some book i used to get a bookmark with every book but with the last 21 books I haven't got any..!!! Opening the package and looking at that cute bookmark was one joy thing..!! I think and hope with next book i'll get it!!!
The most gorgeous artwork in comic books. Contains the most extraordinary artwork of Alex Ross(Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman,  the Justice League, etc, even Hanna-Barbera!) A comics fan, I recieved this as a Christmas gift, and I read it again and again. A must-have for comic book fans.
Did pre-order received today ,but Sita was missing got a preview copy of Ravan , now who kidnapped Sita this time when Ravan is wid me
This book gives a good look at Sita's life right from being an orphan child to her rise to status of a goddess. Language is nice and easy. Characterization is good.
One thing that was super disappointing was "NO BOOKMARK". The only reason for the reduction of the rating!
I have read several of Michael Crichton's books; they are an unequal lot but "Disclosure" is a good read. I think it is the best of all of Crichton's works that I have read. I have a few more to read, I know that some of them will be clunkers, maybe not so bad as "The Great Train Robbery" but they will have a tough time reaching the level of "Disclosure."
Got the book today(29.5.17). The cover page is awesome! But I'm always disappointed with the inner page quality and also haven't got any good page marker(metal) like before when I pre-ordered another series of Amish. Anyway,I'm a big fan of what Amish Sir delivers through his writtings...I hope this one will also give satisfaction. And I liked the surprise! Advertisement of book 3!

The best book, but Why there is no preview chapter of 3rd book Raavana of Rama Series in kindle version of eBook?
This is a very excellent novel with its exhilarating turn of events. The writer gets into each and every minute details of the characters and events so as to give a feeling that we are also a part of this journey. A well planned well said story :)
My recommendation and predictions is skip the current book and the next one too. Read the series from book 4 and come back to 2nd and 3rd after the completion of the series if still interested
And just for a moment, as soon as I opened the cover, I thought I stuck gold where due to a mistake by a Amazon I received the book 3 Raavana. But that didn't last long as it was just a promotional addition.
This novel does not have the research that some of the other Crichton novels have, but it still has a lot of information on random things from the lawes of partial pressure to behavior analysis.
As wrote above, Amish has re-introduced Sita but with highlighting evils that are dwelling in our society against the woman. For instance the following conversation between Sunaina and Janak, "Sunaina looked at her husband and smiled as she caressed the baby's head. 'How can anyone abandon a child like her ?' Janak Sighed.
amazon.in surprised me with the preview of third book in the series!!too excited!!

Just came back from mahishmathi kingdom Waiting to enter again in next part
Bitter relation of Vashishta & Vishwamitra, as well, keep the plot completely gripping part from the philosophical talks that are mentioned above.

Only thing g required is to stop attaching present situations too much.. otherwise a great stuff .
Your agent canceled my pre order and now offering 50rs compensation... And advising to order again.. Thank you
Also why a masculine rule was a good solution for today but and evil for tomorrow.
Very good creativity by Amish, a lot of political wisdom thrown into the book. Awesome. Amish has yet again proved his mantle.
Looking forward to complete the book...i will love it as always loved Amish's writing.
The story revolves around a man named Norman Johnson. Johnson is a phycologist. He travels with 4 other civilans to a remote location in the Pacific Ocean to help the Navy in a top secret misssion. They quickly learn that under the ocean is a half mile long spaceship. The civilans travel to a center 1000 feet under the ocean to live while researching the spacecraft. They are joined by 5 Navy personel to help them run operations. However on the surface a typhoon comes and the support ships on the surface must leave. The team of ten is stuck 1000 feet under the surface of the ocean. After a day under the sea they find out that the spacecraft is actually an American ship that has explored black holes and has brought back some strange things back to earth.
The story is riveting and takes pace from where it stood in the first part. The highlight of the book is how Amish has the skill of tweaking Ramayana to his brilliant convenience keeping the base storyline same. The turns and surprises can be best enjoyed after reading The Scion of Ikshvaku and then picking up The warrior of Mithila. Needless to say, Sita is gloriously portrayed as never before.
Well,the book is no doubt tempting but the point is Amish takes a hell lotta time to write between books.Please keep us waiting for not more than a year.
Better than scion of ikshvaku, but still not that good
Supplement of raavan was a surprise. Thanks

The cover page itself is so much tempting. Amish has never disappointed me, looking forward to finish this book soon. And the preview booklet provided with this book looks cool too. This book Worth's waiting for two years. And thanks to Amazon too for delivering this in the morning.

The book is just amazing. I completed it in one day. The part 3 coming in 2018, i am e agerly waiting for it. Waiting for 2 years was worthwhile
Better than scion of ikshvaku, but still not that good
Finally thirst is being quenched..!!!
I picked up the first book in this series (The Eyre Affair) based purely on its premise and was left somewhat underwhelmed. Still, the potential for the series seemed so large that I went ahead and read this second one too, only to be even less enchanted with the franchise. This is a pure sequel, and any newcomers are advised to read the misadventures of Thursday Next is strict order, lest one miss out of allusions to past events. Although... on further consideration, maybe it doesn't matter, since clearly anything can and will happen in this series, and Fforde isn't all that interested in keeping to a linear plotline anyway.
The imagination the story brings is multifold compared to what is shown in both the Bahubali movies. It is a must read for all Bahubali fans across the globe. Totally up for grabs.
I am not sure who's writing these reviews, but I read repitition after repitition after repitition, with a lot of confusing fluff. Asking hard questions to solve complex or simple issues. What's "fierce" about that?
Pre-ordered the book and got it today. It doesn't matter though, but would be much appreciated if got on the same date as released. Super excited to get this book and the preview of 3rd book of the series. Packaging is good. One small disappointment was that it doesn't have "Bookmark". That's why 1 star less rating.
It is a power struggle with a happy ending(my terminology) if the protagonist has aroused empathy with the reader who may not be maleand hence predisposed, as related in the novel, to view men as always the predator, women as the victim and role reversal is unbelievable.
Sita: warrior of Mithila was good, but as someone rightly pointed out Samichi wasn't as intresting as Vashishta's in the first. also the kindle version doesn't have a sneak peek which i found a bit unfair. Other nthen that no complaints. Worth the wait

Rereading the first book before an enthusiastic eager to start the second.
its all worth it. best book i have read so far perfect and precise visual effects described through words My speed of reading has increased due to high level of curiosity per chapter. i totally suggest this book for purchase !
I have almost always connected Crichton with science fiction and he brings some into this novel, but he is a surprising visionary in that he has forecast (novel first published in 1993) the aceptance of the internet and its worldwide spread coupled with the outcome of the CD war with other magnetic storage devices (tape for video against DVD's and floppy discs for computer storage).
The most gorgeous artwork in comic books. Contains the most extraordinary artwork of Alex Ross(Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman,  the Justice League, etc, even Hanna-Barbera!) A comics fan, I recieved this as a Christmas gift, and I read it again and again. A must-have for comic book fans.
Very good creativity by Amish, a lot of political wisdom thrown into the book. Awesome. Amish has yet again proved his mantle.
Attention!!!! Sita is Vishu.....and the demons know about that.
I loved Sita's character the warrior, the princess and for the most part, however sometimes the author tried to oversimplify her character much to my dislike. I read and reread the parts where she was a feisty princess, I loved her. Nonetheless the parts where she espouses her views about caste system,dharma, patriotism, I somehow felt that she lacked conviction and they sounded too cliched.This is where I felt disappointed with Sita's characterization.
Great work by Amish Exciting book Got it today. Also received a bookmark . Thanks Amazon
They have nothing to lose.......But we should not be blind and assume that all poor are noble. Not everyone has the spirit to keep their character strong when their stomachs are angry. " said Sunaina while giving governing lessons to her daughter, Sita.

If your are bahubali lover don't miss this fiction.It depicts the story of Sivagami and Kattappa before the beginning...The way author written the story is outstanding...It really make u sit and read....
Undoubtedly a great write by Amish, continuing what he left off with the Shiva series this book promises to be a bestseller already.
However, grammar was the only weak part of the book. There were no grammatical errors this time around but the sentence formation was somewhat not upto the mark in certain sections.
Interesting world created by the author good work of fiction. Will be interesting to see how the author handles shambhok
It should not be surprising to find that there is a high load of suspense in trying to find fault, especially since the president of the company is backing the woman. Again, I recommend reading the book to get the full enjoyment of the twists and turns used by Meredith to win top dog position.
The book is just amazing. I completed it in one day. The part 3 coming in 2018, i am e agerly waiting for it. Waiting for 2 years was worthwhile
I already give it a 5 star
I ordered 2 books of Sita and instead I received 2 books of Ravan which is a complementary book and not the actual product.
Only thing g required is to stop attaching present situations too much.. otherwise a great stuff .
If your are bahubali lover don't miss this fiction.It depicts the story of Sivagami and Kattappa before the beginning...The way author written the story is outstanding...It really make u sit and read....
When I want to read a historical fiction, I would want the contemporary influence to be as minimal as possible, if at all there is any it should be really subtle.
Amish is the first author who has made me interested in Indian mythology.I really like the character of SIta portrayed is this book as here she has a much larger role than just being kidnapped by Raavan.The story,narration is really good and there is some light philosophy here and there which I absolute love.
I have received a wrong book. I have not received SITA - Warrior of Mithila.
Awesome Immersive Narration!! Every Scene of mahishmati and Actions mentioned in book seems floating in mind yet and would love to dive again in same world of words in 2nd Part. Only eliminating certain parts (which are to make novel crispier), the book really sets a platform for Bahubali 3.
I like to use the Amazon reviews when purchasing books, especially alert for dissenting perceptions about higly rated items, which usually disuades me from a selection.  So I offer this review that seriously questions the popularity of this work - I found it smug, self-serving and self-indulgent, written by a person with little or no empathy, especially for the people he castigates. For example, his portrayal of the family therapist seems implausible and reaches for effect and panders to the "shrink" bashers of the world. This "play for effect" tone throughout the book was very distasteful to me.
amazing book just recieved it today morning and completed reading also the part 3 preview is amazing.the only thing I hate amish is as he always keep a me waiting .thnx my favourite author.awaiting it next 2 masterpieces.
THis book was horrible.  If it was possible to rate it lower than one star i would have.  I am an avid reader and picked this book up after my mom had gotten it from a friend.  I read half of it, suffering from a headache the entire time, and then got to the part about the relationship the 13 year old boy had with a 33 year old man and i lit this book on fire.  One less copy in the world...don't waste your money.
Amazing story telling from a different point of view. What if it actually was true? As always hungry for Ravaan
I already give it a 5 star
I have not received any type of phone call for the expected delivery of the novel- Sits the warrior of mithila even though I received the message of its delivery date. And it is quite frustrating when it happens two times in a row. Hope you will take some necessary actions.
Finally thirst is being quenched..!!!
Lengthy paragraphs...but good work.
I loved Sita's character the warrior, the princess and for the most part, however sometimes the author tried to oversimplify her character much to my dislike. I read and reread the parts where she was a feisty princess, I loved her. Nonetheless the parts where she espouses her views about caste system,dharma, patriotism, I somehow felt that she lacked conviction and they sounded too cliched.This is where I felt disappointed with Sita's characterization.
This is Aryan I forget to eat food today ....indulged in divine journey of seeta....amazing... And after a long wait ...its worth reading
First of all i am a big fan of amish sir and i had read all the books he had written. I have received my order today and i am excited to read it. I know that this book is also going to be blockbuster.
This is only first part of revenge by shivgami. Story telling is good but there are lot of dark things mentioned, which are many time unnecessary I felt. Due to which this book should not be given to children. Otherwise good enough!
Your agent canceled my pre order and now offering 50rs compensation... And advising to order again.. Thank you
Also why a masculine rule was a good solution for today but and evil for tomorrow.
This book gives a good look at Sita's life right from being an orphan child to her rise to status of a goddess. Language is nice and easy. Characterization is good.
Awesome is the word to describe Amish' writing style. Blending mythology and fiction and making it app at real as if you have lived it. Fantastic.
Amish has changed the way our mythology has been spun since ages
Rereading the first book before an enthusiastic eager to start the second.
Excellent and strong portrayal of lady Sita's point of view. Can't wait for the next book to be released. Totally immersive!
And just for a moment, as soon as I opened the cover, I thought I stuck gold where due to a mistake by a Amazon I received the book 3 Raavana. But that didn't last long as it was just a promotional addition.
I hate u Amazon..... Y only 5 stars...... It should have 10 stars.... Completely amazing book.
Rereading the first book before an enthusiastic eager to start the second.
Lengthy paragraphs...but good work.
I am not sure who's writing these reviews, but I read repitition after repitition after repitition, with a lot of confusing fluff. Asking hard questions to solve complex or simple issues. What's "fierce" about that?

I have picked up this book after reading the first book in the Ramachandra series. However I should say this book has not lived up to the benchmark set by the previous book. I love Amish's story telling technique and the way he builds the characters. When I read "Scion of Ikshvaku", I fell in love with Lakshman, Ram, Sita, Jatayu and others. When I read "Sita - Warrior of Mithila", I fell in love with Sunaina and fell for Jatayu again.
didn't start yet but one thing amish books are amazing for that I'm sure really loved the packing from Amazon and the Ravaan first cover was like Superb eagerly waiting for that and the final book
I picked up the first book in this series (The Eyre Affair) based purely on its premise and was left somewhat underwhelmed. Still, the potential for the series seemed so large that I went ahead and read this second one too, only to be even less enchanted with the franchise. This is a pure sequel, and any newcomers are advised to read the misadventures of Thursday Next is strict order, lest one miss out of allusions to past events. Although... on further consideration, maybe it doesn't matter, since clearly anything can and will happen in this series, and Fforde isn't all that interested in keeping to a linear plotline anyway.
The imagination the story brings is multifold compared to what is shown in both the Bahubali movies. It is a must read for all Bahubali fans across the globe. Totally up for grabs.
Bitter relation of Vashishta & Vishwamitra, as well, keep the plot completely gripping part from the philosophical talks that are mentioned above.
This is only first part of revenge by shivgami. Story telling is good but there are lot of dark things mentioned, which are many time unnecessary I felt. Due to which this book should not be given to children. Otherwise good enough!
The book will be a nice collection for a book lover with the addition of the other two issues .The story is really nice and there was not a single page where I felt bored and I did not know when I came to the last part of the book and I am really eager what is in store in the next issues. It contains adult related writing so it is not for children.

Dr. Oz is an accomplished heart surgeon in the field of cardiac transplantation. He describes how he combines complementary medicine (e.g. hypnosis, reflexology, yoga, message, acupuncture. Etc) with orthodox Western medicine. There is an excellent forward by Dr Dean Ornish, and an interesting epilogue containing an overview of the complementary medicine techniques. The bulk of the book contains stories of patients Dr. Oz treated using this revolutionary way. I am a cardiologist, and I have a great interest in combining western medicine with complementary medicine, which is the reason I bought this book. However this book was a bit boring to read and was also a bit of a disappointment. Nevertheless, those interested in this new medicine, which I think will be the medicine of the new millennium, will want to read this book.
Fast Delivery and Awesome product quality !!!
Worth a read. the narrative keeps you engrossed right uptill the climax, and also keeps you hooked on to the series.
Sita the warrior princes continues to project the lacunae in Amish's craft... The failure to create a different world and drawing continuing parallels with current India irritates.. Ofcourse its a fast read of the quintessential Amish genre and the story is definitely interesting... Alas... the devil in the details disappoints agai
Sphere by Michael Crichton is an excellant novel. This was certainly the hardest to put down of all of the Crichton novels that I have read.
Great story waiting for second part
Better than scion of ikshvaku, but still not that good
Undoubtedly a great write by Amish, continuing what he left off with the Shiva series this book promises to be a bestseller already.

Thanks AmazonIN for such a quick delivery!
It gave 5 shocks in the first chapter itself Shock 1: Sita is a Vishnu (The is also a clue about this in the last paragraph of Scion of Ikshvaku) Shock 2: Sita knows she is a Vishnu Shock 3: Jatayu was previously a Lankan and was loyal to Raavan (This clue is also mentioned in the last chapter of Scion of Ikshvaku) Shock 4: The Lankans also know that Sita is a Vishnu Shock 5: The Lankans knew Sita since her childhood and she also had a memory of the Lankan captain Khar from her distant past
One can negotiate with greed. But the criminals among the poor are driven by desperation and anger. Desperation can sometimes bring out the best in a human being. That's why the poor can often be noble. But desperation can also bring out the worst.
Loved it.. really proud of being INDIAN..our history rocks.. hats off to Amish for such a wonderful book..keep it up..looking forward for more such gems..
Thanks AmazonIN for such a quick delivery!
Supplement of raavan was a surprise. Thanks
This is book is the fiction story of the author, who does not know have the basic knowledge of Ramayan, his book is far from reality & he is misguiding about the role of Mother Sita. Extremely disappointed
Considering everyone knows the basic storyline of Ramayana, the book still has interesting philosophies in it.
It's one of the best books written by one of the best Indian authors
The story revolves around a man named Norman Johnson. Johnson is a phycologist. He travels with 4 other civilans to a remote location in the Pacific Ocean to help the Navy in a top secret misssion. They quickly learn that under the ocean is a half mile long spaceship. The civilans travel to a center 1000 feet under the ocean to live while researching the spacecraft. They are joined by 5 Navy personel to help them run operations. However on the surface a typhoon comes and the support ships on the surface must leave. The team of ten is stuck 1000 feet under the surface of the ocean. After a day under the sea they find out that the spacecraft is actually an American ship that has explored black holes and has brought back some strange things back to earth.
Thanks AmazonIN for such a quick delivery!
Book is more about philosophies than detailed warfare and unknown plots.
This book is really worth to be a bestseller......... The story is really fascinating......... Author Amish has not let down our expectations...... But little bit disappointed as I did not get any bookmark from Amazon
I hate u Amazon..... Y only 5 stars...... It should have 10 stars.... Completely amazing book.
there is a story with twists n turns weaved with our history. it also builds charachters n importantly with hows and whys
One can negotiate with greed. But the criminals among the poor are driven by desperation and anger. Desperation can sometimes bring out the best in a human being. That's why the poor can often be noble. But desperation can also bring out the worst.
My one complaint (other than the slow start) is the whole thing with the virtual reality file system in the book, where users walk on a treadmill through halls of files to find stuff they need (as opposed to just opening a file menu and searching like that). I'm pretty sure Crichton felt he had to throw in some cool tech like he usually does, but here it doesn't fit at all and isn't even cool. But I didn't think this detracted much from how entertaining the book was.

Nevertheless a good read. Looking forward to next.
I found that a little tiresome but maybe it's because it's now almost 20 years since the book came out and the jargon has become more popular. Even if you are not very tech-savvy, you can understand words such as CD-ROM, RAM, hypertext, wireless, etc. I imagine such technical explanation was helpful in the mid-nineties. But, overall, it's a great book.
Got my copy yesterday along with the preview of Raavan-Orphan of Aryavarta....before the date of delivery.....that's why i love amazon!!! Awesome cover design!!!
Anybody who is planning to start this book should know that this isn't starting from the point 'The Scion of Ikshvaku' left off. This is the story of Sita from her birth till the point where Raavan kidnaps her.
This book was absolutely worth the wait of two years because the idea of multilinear narrative is really good and I can't wait to explore the character of Raavan in the next book.
Even though it is not a sequel of the frist book ,it is very good. Hoping the next book will not take 2 years
Amish Tripathi is indeed the best writer in India in the recent time.
Awesome book with great twists and gripping style. Worth my reading time.
This is Aryan I forget to eat food today ....indulged in divine journey of seeta....amazing... And after a long wait ...its worth reading

Another epic story by Amish. Received the book today. awesome cover and highly amazed about the preview copy of Raavan : The son of aryavarta. I've read all previous book from Amish and hope this keep the excitement retained after Scion of ikshavaku....finger crossed and hop RSOA is launched soon!!
In our urban society, there is a very common myth that poor are usually bad and avaricious people but Amish has bolted some logical words that will make readers understand that why and how, many times, a poor man is forced to be indulged in crime. "The Criminals among the rich are mostly driven by greed.
Instead of Sits , I was given Raavan the third book of Ram Chandra series
Well I like the first book of the Ram Chandra Series and waited a frickin more than 1 and a half year for the second part. So as soon as I saw that prr booking offer I just placed it. And boy I loved this book ( not as much as the first book). But now today on 2nd of June I saw that PayTm is selling the same book at way cheaper price, I'm confused whether it was good choice pre ordering a book or should have waited for few days and bought it from PayTm. Thoughts anyone?
If I order the book now...will I get the preview of the Raavan with this.....because have not pre ordered it...
Note to others: You need not have read Scion of Ikshvaku to read Sita (though I loved the previous part too). So if you are planning to just read this one, you can start from here.
The book was ok..after 200 pages story loses momentum...still looking forward to the next book on Ravana
This novel does not have the research that some of the other Crichton novels have, but it still has a lot of information on random things from the lawes of partial pressure to behavior analysis.
Supplement of raavan was a surprise. Thanks
Very good creativity by Amish, a lot of political wisdom thrown into the book. Awesome. Amish has yet again proved his mantle.
This is Aryan I forget to eat food today ....indulged in divine journey of seeta....amazing... And after a long wait ...its worth reading
One thing that was super disappointing was "NO BOOKMARK". The only reason for the reduction of the rating!
Thanks AmazonIN for such a quick delivery!
After Naga series,Ram Chandra series too has proved the aforesaid.
This book is really worth to be a bestseller......... The story is really fascinating......... Author Amish has not let down our expectations...... But little bit disappointed as I did not get any bookmark from Amazon
Even though it is not a sequel of the frist book ,it is very good. Hoping the next book will not take 2 years
Great work by Amish Exciting book Got it today. Also received a bookmark . Thanks Amazon
Amish has the knack of leaving you speechless and craving for more... Can't wait for the next installment... This one was definitely better than its prequel... He's raised expectations for his next!
I already give it a 5 star
Certainly Crichton has covered a wide variety of themes in his writing, or maybe I should say plots, some writers have said there are only seven themes in all writing and I tend to agree given their definitions, but whichever, "Disclosure" is more than just conflict between men and women portrayed by sexual drive and its common viewpoint.
My one complaint (other than the slow start) is the whole thing with the virtual reality file system in the book, where users walk on a treadmill through halls of files to find stuff they need (as opposed to just opening a file menu and searching like that). I'm pretty sure Crichton felt he had to throw in some cool tech like he usually does, but here it doesn't fit at all and isn't even cool. But I didn't think this detracted much from how entertaining the book was.
My sister bought it for me. Got it on Monday. Looking forward to read it. I was expecting cool bookmark with book art but didn't get one.
Completed three chapters, so good so far!!! And the little Sita in the second chapter looking so cuteðŸ˜˜ðŸ˜˜ 'sleeping like angel'
The book is just amazing. I completed it in one day. The part 3 coming in 2018, i am e agerly waiting for it. Waiting for 2 years was worthwhile
Got only the complimentary book.
But that's okay.....worth waiting.
Note to others: You need not have read Scion of Ikshvaku to read Sita (though I loved the previous part too). So if you are planning to just read this one, you can start from here.
I loved Sita's character the warrior, the princess and for the most part, however sometimes the author tried to oversimplify her character much to my dislike.

Nonetheless the parts where she espouses her views about caste system,dharma, patriotism, I somehow felt that she lacked conviction and they sounded too cliched.This is where I felt disappointed with Sita's characterization.
I have read several of Michael Crichton's books; they are an unequal lot but "Disclosure" is a good read. I think it is the best of all of Crichton's works that I have read. I have a few more to read, I know that some of them will be clunkers, maybe not so bad as "The Great Train Robbery" but they will have a tough time reaching the level of "Disclosure."
Unlike other princesses, Sita was made to study not just science and philosophy but also learned the martial arts and warfare combat. Later Sita was nurtured as the person who will play a crucial role in making India as the brightest nation again. And in her quest to complete her mission, she chose Ram as her partner. Sita ruled with pragmatism while Ram sticked to the laws. In sita, Ram found an "Ardhangini ", a life-partner who wishes to bring the glory to India.
Awesome waiting for the next book in line.
I must say "The read was much more than its worth"
Shiva trilogy was a new story so it had its suspense. Ramachandra Series is a well known story, so it has its difficulties in creating suspense.
It's one of the best books written by one of the best Indian authors
there is a story with twists n turns weaved with our history. it also builds charachters n importantly with hows and whys
delivered on my birthday so happy..
Attention!!!! Sita is Vishu.....and the demons know about that.
Amazing book!!! But only one thing, in the past whenever i ordered some book i used to get a bookmark with every book but with the last 21 books I haven't got any..!!! Opening the package and looking at that cute bookmark was one joy thing..!! I think and hope with next book i'll get it!!!
i just got it last night and already half way but was dissapointed as this was not authographed by Amish as the last one.... was hoping to preorder will be more collectible of a kind
Not only do I disagree with his opinions, but some of his facts are blatently false.  On page 106 he refers to violence agains Native Americans by European settlers as "isolated instances" and not planned nor calculated.  Had to read it for a class and it was less then enjoyable.
Amish is the first author who has made me interested in Indian mythology.I really like the character of SIta portrayed is this book as here she has a much larger role than just being kidnapped by Raavan.The story,narration is really good and there is some light philosophy here and there which I absolute love.

The imagination the story brings is multifold compared to what is shown in both the Bahubali movies. It is a must read for all Bahubali fans across the globe. Totally up for grabs.
I was also wondering how will Amish introduce the process of "churning" Somras. Agatsyakootam and the river was brilliant(if i am correct).
This is my second favorite Crichton book after Jurassic Park. It starts off slow (like the first 50 pages) but once it gets going, it GOES. You really end up hating Meredith and rooting for Sanders to prevail.
Rereading the first book before an enthusiastic eager to start the second.
Amazing writing as usual my Amish Tripathi. I have been a fan of Amish's since Immortals of Meluha came out. The day i ordered this book, i binge read all the four books before. In LOVE with his books. Please release Raavan - Orphan of Aryavarta soon.
Rating it without reading. I know it's a masterpiece. Got my copy today.And already in love with the cover.
I got my book before time..it was really very nice..for the first time amazon made me happy.
I hate u Amazon..... Y only 5 stars...... It should have 10 stars.... Completely amazing book.

Considering everyone knows the basic storyline of Ramayana, the book still has interesting philosophies in it.
It's a great book worth reading waiting for Raavan .... Can't wait more
I always thought that nothing could be better than Shiva Trilogy, but I was wrong. Mr. Tripathi has let us explore that world, in more depth, which he introduced us in Shiva Trilogy. Sita - The Warrior Of Mithila has become a source of power for me. Trust me, you can't afford to miss this one. love, Laughter and Peace
amazing book just recieved it today morning and completed reading also the part 3 preview is amazing.the only thing I hate amish is as he always keep a me waiting .thnx my favourite author.awaiting it next 2 masterpieces.
If your are bahubali lover don't miss this fiction.It depicts the story of Sivagami and Kattappa before the beginning...The way author written the story is outstanding...It really make u sit and read....

Sphere by Michael Crichton is an excellant novel. This was certainly the hardest to put down of all of the Crichton novels that I have read.
Interesting world created by the author good work of fiction. Will be interesting to see how the author handles shambhok
Amazing story telling from a different point of view. What if it actually was true? As always hungry for Ravaan
The story of a woman whose name is taken as the ideal role model for all women in India. The book has indeed done justice to the character of Sita. I loved seeing Sita as the one who takes charge, crafts her own destiny (and those who she loves!), strategises and executes each of her plans. A must read just for those who want to admire the completeness of her character.
Amazing. Just start reading and get on the beautiful thrilling journey- Sita
Note to others: You need not have read Scion of Ikshvaku to read Sita (though I loved the previous part too). So if you are planning to just read this one, you can start from here.
The most gorgeous artwork in comic books. Contains the most extraordinary artwork of Alex Ross(Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman,  the Justice League, etc, even Hanna-Barbera!) A comics fan, I recieved this as a Christmas gift, and I read it again and again. A must-have for comic book fans.

Got it today. Hope it is as good as the first. :D Looking forward to read it.

For those who regularly read Amish, Sita has a lot to reveal about his world creation. In fact, I started seeing his previous series, the Shiva Trilogy in a new light. Shall write a longer review soon. But I am yet to see a book that brings the whole splendour of the phenomenon called India in front of our eyes like Sita does. If you are a woman, it is a must read. If you are a patriot (not a jingoist), it is a must read. If you are a lover of creativity, it is a must read.
Another epic story by Amish. Received the book today. awesome cover and highly amazed about the preview copy of Raavan : The son of aryavarta. I've read all previous book from Amish and hope this keep the excitement retained after Scion of ikshavaku....finger crossed and hop RSOA is launched soon!!
I have received a wrong book. I have not received SITA - Warrior of Mithila.
Did pre-order received today ,but Sita was missing got a preview copy of Ravan , now who kidnapped Sita this time when Ravan is wid me
How can I book 3 which is not even published instead of book 2 which is only published yesterday.

I wish i had the time spent reading this book back so i could use it for better purposes.  THis book wasted my life.
Got only the complimentary book.
If I order the book now...will I get the preview of the Raavan with this.....because have not pre ordered it...
Undoubtedly a great write by Amish, continuing what he left off with the Shiva series this book promises to be a bestseller already.

'Many People are not wise enough to count life's blessing. They keep focusing instead on what the world has denied them '", depicts the unfortunate truth of Indian societies in which Girl child are abandoned. Although many women have achieved what men failed to but in some societies girl child is still considered as an ill omen and Amish has rightly depicted how a girl child is a blessing.Apart from raising the tacit issue that Woman should be treated equally, Amish has bolted anecdotes that remind the citizens of their individual duties towards the Nation.
worst
Just came back from mahishmathi kingdom Waiting to enter again in next part

Amish has the knack of leaving you speechless and craving for more... Can't wait for the next installment... This one was definitely better than its prequel... He's raised expectations for his next!
Wonderful narration, true feminism. Sita is not weak but she sometimes adjust to circumstances. As per her school name bhoomi, my guess is that she is the one who founded panchavati in Amish Shiva trilogy, bhumi Devi of naga's. It could be Amish way of traditional ramayana in which Rama and sita stay away once sita is pregnant and for good
This is only first part of revenge by shivgami. Story telling is good but there are lot of dark things mentioned, which are many time unnecessary I felt. Due to which this book should not be given to children. Otherwise good enough!
Certainly Crichton has covered a wide variety of themes in his writing, or maybe I should say plots, some writers have said there are only seven themes in all writing and I tend to agree given their definitions, but whichever, "Disclosure" is more than just conflict between men and women portrayed by sexual drive and its common viewpoint.
Bitter relation of Vashishta & Vishwamitra, as well, keep the plot completely gripping part from the philosophical talks that are mentioned above.
Awesome book, with shocking surprises and fascinating story.
Instead of Sits , I was given Raavan the third book of Ram Chandra series
Sita the warrior princes continues to project the lacunae in Amish's craft... The failure to create a different world and drawing continuing parallels with current India irritates.. Ofcourse its a fast read of the quintessential Amish genre and the story is definitely interesting... Alas... the devil in the details disappoints agai
'Many People are not wise enough to count life's blessing. They keep focusing instead on what the world has denied them '", depicts the unfortunate truth of Indian societies in which Girl child are abandoned. Although many women have achieved what men failed to but in some societies girl child is still considered as an ill omen and Amish has rightly depicted how a girl child is a blessing.Apart from raising the tacit issue that Woman should be treated equally, Amish has bolted anecdotes that remind the citizens of their individual duties towards the Nation.
Fast paced, breath taking and nail biting till the last page...
Brilliant book. Excellent insight into Sita's world. Finished the book within 24 hours of super-speed delivery from Amazon.in. Moreover got an exclusive preview of the next book too. Thank you Amazon.in. And more importantly thank you amish for this awe inspiring book.
As wrote above, Amish has re-introduced Sita but with highlighting evils that are dwelling in our society against the woman. For instance the following conversation between Sunaina and Janak, "Sunaina looked at her husband and smiled as she caressed the baby's head. 'How can anyone abandon a child like her ?' Janak Sighed.
I wish i had the time spent reading this book back so i could use it for better purposes.  THis book wasted my life.
When I want to read a historical fiction, I would want the contemporary influence to be as minimal as possible, if at all there is any it should be really subtle.
How the two most important and intelligent clans can be right and wrong at the same time.
I loved Sita's character the warrior, the princess and for the most part, however sometimes the author tried to oversimplify her character much to my dislike. I read and reread the parts where she was a feisty princess, I loved her. Nonetheless the parts where she espouses her views about caste system,dharma, patriotism, I somehow felt that she lacked conviction and they sounded too cliched.This is where I felt disappointed with Sita's characterization.
Completed three chapters, so good so far!!! And the little Sita in the second chapter looking so cuteðŸ˜˜ðŸ˜˜ 'sleeping like angel'
Amish Tripathi is indeed the best writer in India in the recent time.
'Many people are not wise enough to count life's blessings. They keep focusing instead on what the world has denied them.'-Janak, when they found Sita.
One thing that was super disappointing was "NO BOOKMARK". The only reason for the reduction of the rating!
Nevertheless a good read. Looking forward to next.
I have received a wrong book. I have not received SITA - Warrior of Mithila.

First of all i am a big fan of amish sir and i had read all the books he had written. I have received my order today and i am excited to read it. I know that this book is also going to be blockbuster.
I got the book for free luckily under Kindle promotions. Thanks Amazon and thanks Amish, for an enjoyable read.
Loved it.. really proud of being INDIAN..our history rocks.. hats off to Amish for such a wonderful book..keep it up..looking forward for more such gems..
amazon.in surprised me with the preview of third book in the series!!too excited!!

The book tries to explain the enigma that is Sivagami. The narrative is impressive as well as gripping. Still one would have expected to have a few more answers like the story behind Bijjala's paralised arm and how he marries Sivagami. The book seems to confuse matters even further as Sivagami is now Mahadeva's love interest. How many more titles before we get all the answers?

Looking forward to complete the book...i will love it as always loved Amish's writing.
Bitter relation of Vashishta & Vishwamitra, as well, keep the plot completely gripping part from the philosophical talks that are mentioned above.
The book was excellent in the first half but as it intersected with the 1st books , the anticipation and the suspense died for certain parts. The writing style is certainly much better than any of the previous ones and the time that took to write the book was certainly worth it.

The story revolves around a man named Norman Johnson. Johnson is a phycologist. He travels with 4 other civilans to a remote location in the Pacific Ocean to help the Navy in a top secret misssion. They quickly learn that under the ocean is a half mile long spaceship. The civilans travel to a center 1000 feet under the ocean to live while researching the spacecraft. They are joined by 5 Navy personel to help them run operations. However on the surface a typhoon comes and the support ships on the surface must leave. The team of ten is stuck 1000 feet under the surface of the ocean. After a day under the sea they find out that the spacecraft is actually an American ship that has explored black holes and has brought back some strange things back to earth.
Sita: warrior of Mithila was good, but as someone rightly pointed out Samichi wasn't as intresting as Vashishta's in the first. also the kindle version doesn't have a sneak peek which i found a bit unfair. Other nthen that no complaints. Worth the wait

No party of society can be ignored. Army, business , the poor , the rich all are a part of society and if anyone one is ignored the society will fall.
This book gives a good look at Sita's life right from being an orphan child to her rise to status of a goddess. Language is nice and easy. Characterization is good.
The most gorgeous artwork in comic books. Contains the most extraordinary artwork of Alex Ross(Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman,  the Justice League, etc, even Hanna-Barbera!) A comics fan, I recieved this as a Christmas gift, and I read it again and again. A must-have for comic book fans.
I have received a wrong book. I have not received SITA - Warrior of Mithila.
Awesome waiting for the next book in line.
The book was ok..after 200 pages story loses momentum...still looking forward to the next book on Ravana
Fast Delivery and Awesome product quality !!!
It should not be surprising to find that there is a high load of suspense in trying to find fault, especially since the president of the company is backing the woman. Again, I recommend reading the book to get the full enjoyment of the twists and turns used by Meredith to win top dog position.

amazing book just recieved it today morning and completed reading also the part 3 preview is amazing.the only thing I hate amish is as he always keep a me waiting .thnx my favourite author.awaiting it next 2 masterpieces.
The writing style and content just didn't flow. Wasn't real. I mean, in one section, she actually uses the term "bucko," as in, "Let me tell you something, bucko." What are we in "Happy Days?" Couldn't take the book seriously after that. Very bad.
Thanks AmazonIN for such a quick delivery!
All the broad philosophical themes are still there, the epic vision and imagination still exists but they don't work in harmony. They seem like individual set pieces that don't quite fill up the final storyboard, thus the attempted emotional mileage fell short most of the times and there are supposedly times when Amish dives more into the details, which is fine but you can't help but feel like he is pondering over these details to keep the pieces stitched together, in more straightforward terms, it felt draggy, especially the latter half of the book.
the package was torn but the book and the Raavan's prologue or peek in was in shape. Already excited to commence reading it.
I wish i had the time spent reading this book back so i could use it for better purposes.  THis book wasted my life.
Not only do I disagree with his opinions, but some of his facts are blatently false.  On page 106 he refers to violence agains Native Americans by European settlers as "isolated instances" and not planned nor calculated.  Had to read it for a class and it was less then enjoyable.
Loved it.. really proud of being INDIAN..our history rocks.. hats off to Amish for such a wonderful book..keep it up..looking forward for more such gems..
I ordered 2 books of Sita and instead I received 2 books of Ravan which is a complementary book and not the actual product.
Also why a masculine rule was a good solution for today but and evil for tomorrow.
amazon.in surprised me with the preview of third book in the series!!too excited!!
Fast paced, breath taking and nail biting till the last page...
Rereading the first book before an enthusiastic eager to start the second.
I picked up the first book in this series (The Eyre Affair) based purely on its premise and was left somewhat underwhelmed. Still, the potential for the series seemed so large that I went ahead and read this second one too, only to be even less enchanted with the franchise. This is a pure sequel, and any newcomers are advised to read the misadventures of Thursday Next is strict order, lest one miss out of allusions to past events. Although... on further consideration, maybe it doesn't matter, since clearly anything can and will happen in this series, and Fforde isn't all that interested in keeping to a linear plotline anyway.
It gave 5 shocks in the first chapter itself Shock 1: Sita is a Vishnu (The is also a clue about this in the last paragraph of Scion of Ikshvaku) Shock 2: Sita knows she is a Vishnu Shock 3: Jatayu was previously a Lankan and was loyal to Raavan (This clue is also mentioned in the last chapter of Scion of Ikshvaku) Shock 4: The Lankans also know that Sita is a Vishnu Shock 5: The Lankans knew Sita since her childhood and she also had a memory of the Lankan captain Khar from her distant past
Pre-ordered the book and got it today. It doesn't matter though, but would be much appreciated if got on the same date as released. Super excited to get this book and the preview of 3rd book of the series. Packaging is good. One small disappointment was that it doesn't have "Bookmark". That's why 1 star less rating.
Amazing book!!! But only one thing, in the past whenever i ordered some book i used to get a bookmark with every book but with the last 21 books I haven't got any..!!! Opening the package and looking at that cute bookmark was one joy thing..!! I think and hope with next book i'll get it!!!
there is a story with twists n turns weaved with our history. it also builds charachters n importantly with hows and whys
Since it is the fight for CD usage that is one of the key points in the story and with the female antagonist trying to ruin Tom Sanders over his use of the CD as storage it is a shame that production is the battleground, not fact that one form of storage is inherently better than the other. It is Meredith's knuckling under to Malaysian pressure to increase use of local labor and not use machines that has to be proven, getting away from the science of magnetic devices.
Each chapter made me spellbound...Just can't wait for the next book...Curious to know more about the mahishmati secrets...Thank you..Will wait..
I got my book before time..it was really very nice..for the first time amazon made me happy.
Amish Tripathi is indeed the best writer in India in the recent time.
Rereading the first book before an enthusiastic eager to start the second.
The RamChandra series is a prequel to Shiv trilogy so the reader already has an big idea of the revelations and ending of the series. To make matter even more Worse the current book starts of before Book1, overlaps all events to give the second protagonist point of view. May be to few this does not sound as bad as it is because they may argue that reading a story from a second point of view is also riveting.
Awesome is the word to describe Amish' writing style. Blending mythology and fiction and making it app at real as if you have lived it. Fantastic.
After seeking the blessings of Kanyakumari , Child Goddess, Janak and Sunaina came across a quaint scene. An injured vulture was surrounded by the pack of wolves and watching this unfair act of aggression, Sunaina spurred her horse to protect the bird and from some distance that the vulture was protecting a baby from the pack of the wolves.Goading her horses into a fierce gallop, Sunaina pressed forward to protect the child and the vulture. Sunaina's arrival scared the wolves to run away and with an approval from Janak, that abandoned child was named as Sita Ã§ause she was found in a furrow in Mother Earth and raised as the princess of Mithila.
I have received a wrong book. I have not received SITA - Warrior of Mithila.
Wonderful narration, true feminism. Sita is not weak but she sometimes adjust to circumstances. As per her school name bhoomi, my guess is that she is the one who founded panchavati in Amish Shiva trilogy, bhumi Devi of naga's. It could be Amish way of traditional ramayana in which Rama and sita stay away once sita is pregnant and for good
Rereading the first book before an enthusiastic eager to start the second.
Sphere by Michael Crichton is an excellant novel. This was certainly the hardest to put down of all of the Crichton novels that I have read.
It should not be surprising to find that there is a high load of suspense in trying to find fault, especially since the president of the company is backing the woman. Again, I recommend reading the book to get the full enjoyment of the twists and turns used by Meredith to win top dog position.

The book is just amazing. I completed it in one day. The part 3 coming in 2018, i am e agerly waiting for it. Waiting for 2 years was worthwhile
Also why a masculine rule was a good solution for today but and evil for tomorrow.
This was an outstanding read and very well written as can be expected for a Michael Crighton book. I think this was one of the better books I've read. The plot was well crafted and developed, and the subject matter is so thoroughly interesting and fascinating. Perhaps the most amazing aspect of the book is how Crighton writes about virtual reality and what eventually came to be Ipad devices technologies in such a prescient and eerily accurate way 25 years before these technologies were implemented. I never cease to be amazed by the genius who was Michael Crighton.
This is a very excellent novel with its exhilarating turn of events. The writer gets into each and every minute details of the characters and events so as to give a feeling that we are also a part of this journey. A well planned well said story :)
The best book, but Why there is no preview chapter of 3rd book Raavana of Rama Series in kindle version of eBook?
If you have read "Scion of Ikshvaku", you can read half of the book and then gently ignore the remaining chapters and move on to the last one. Amish should have written this book in 180-200 pages at the most, there is lot of repetition from the first part, not just scenes but chapters together. He should have avoided this and made this book more gripping.

I am not sure who's writing these reviews, but I read repitition after repitition after repitition, with a lot of confusing fluff. Asking hard questions to solve complex or simple issues. What's "fierce" about that?
Sphere by Michael Crichton is an excellant novel. This was certainly the hardest to put down of all of the Crichton novels that I have read.
The book will be a nice collection for a book lover with the addition of the other two issues .The story is really nice and there was not a single page where I felt bored and I did not know when I came to the last part of the book and I am really eager what is in store in the next issues. It contains adult related writing so it is not for children.
In our urban society, there is a very common myth that poor are usually bad and avaricious people but Amish has bolted some logical words that will make readers understand that why and how, many times, a poor man is forced to be indulged in crime. "The Criminals among the rich are mostly driven by greed.
Excellence writing once again by Amish, Sitamata ki jai Jai Shri Ram
This book is really worth to be a bestseller......... The story is really fascinating......... Author Amish has not let down our expectations...... But little bit disappointed as I did not get any bookmark from Amazon
Loved it.. really proud of being INDIAN..our history rocks.. hats off to Amish for such a wonderful book..keep it up..looking forward for more such gems..

Awesome book, with shocking surprises and fascinating story.
Excellent and strong portrayal of lady Sita's point of view. Can't wait for the next book to be released. Totally immersive!
good price and excellent delivery.
Had pre-ordered the book. Got it today. Too excited to start this new journey of Amish's imagination! The cover of the sneak preview book of the third book, "Raavan" looks amaziiiiinng!
If your are bahubali lover don't miss this fiction.It depicts the story of Sivagami and Kattappa before the beginning...The way author written the story is outstanding...It really make u sit and read....
The writing style and content just didn't flow. Wasn't real. I mean, in one section, she actually uses the term "bucko," as in, "Let me tell you something, bucko." What are we in "Happy Days?" Couldn't take the book seriously after that. Very bad.
My sister bought it for me. Got it on Monday. Looking forward to read it. I was expecting cool bookmark with book art but didn't get one.
Got only the complimentary book.
It's a great book worth reading waiting for Raavan .... Can't wait more
Got my copy yesterday along with the preview of Raavan-Orphan of Aryavarta....before the date of delivery.....that's why i love amazon!!! Awesome cover design!!!
Runs with the Speed of FGFA !!! After the long wait of 2 years, finally yesterday, "Sita - Warrior Of Mithila " was delivered to me ( at 1556 hours ) and I started the book in the late evening and wrapped it in a single sitting. Like the spell bounded the first installment of the Ram Chandra Series, Sita-Warrior of Mithila "reads with the speed tantamount to any fifth-generation fighter jet. The depiction of a woman warrior justifies the title of the book.
Awesome book with great twists and gripping style. Worth my reading time.
The book describes sita's perspective in a very good manner. Though i felt some parts were similar to the first book of Ram Chandra series. Overall the essence was well captured and overall it intrigues you to know what happens later.
Amazing. Just start reading and get on the beautiful thrilling journey- Sita

Amish is really sorry for the delay, yes!!! Look in to the book.
Completed three chapters, so good so far!!! And the little Sita in the second chapter looking so cuteðŸ˜˜ðŸ˜˜ 'sleeping like angel'
Hehe...one more thing....Hanu bhaiya is also here.
Amish tries some of the usual tricks of weaving too much of contemporary politics and events. They was a wow in Meluha when we read this for the first time but not here. Nothing can beat the need for a story and may be a new bag of tricks
amazon.in surprised me with the preview of third book in the series!!too excited!!
My recommendation and predictions is skip the current book and the next one too. Read the series from book 4 and come back to 2nd and 3rd after the completion of the series if still interested
This book is really worth to be a bestseller......... The story is really fascinating......... Author Amish has not let down our expectations...... But little bit disappointed as I did not get any bookmark from Amazon
The best book, but Why there is no preview chapter of 3rd book Raavana of Rama Series in kindle version of eBook?
Amish has changed the way our mythology has been spun since ages
Considering everyone knows the basic storyline of Ramayana, the book still has interesting philosophies in it.
I have received a wrong book. I have not received SITA - Warrior of Mithila.
Looking forward to complete the book...i will love it as always loved Amish's writing.
Got the book today(29.5.17). The cover page is awesome! But I'm always disappointed with the inner page quality and also haven't got any good page marker(metal) like before when I pre-ordered another series of Amish. Anyway,I'm a big fan of what Amish Sir delivers through his writtings...I hope this one will also give satisfaction. And I liked the surprise! Advertisement of book 3!

Anybody who is planning to start this book should know that this isn't starting from the point 'The Scion of Ikshvaku' left off. This is the story of Sita from her birth till the point where Raavan kidnaps her.
The book describes sita's perspective in a very good manner. Though i felt some parts were similar to the first book of Ram Chandra series. Overall the essence was well captured and overall it intrigues you to know what happens later.

This novel does not have the research that some of the other Crichton novels have, but it still has a lot of information on random things from the lawes of partial pressure to behavior analysis.
Will update the review as I read the book but I don't think that the stars will come down from 5!
The most gorgeous artwork in comic books. Contains the most extraordinary artwork of Alex Ross(Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman,  the Justice League, etc, even Hanna-Barbera!) A comics fan, I recieved this as a Christmas gift, and I read it again and again. A must-have for comic book fans.

Got a pre ordered copy today ans just completed the 1st chapter of this epic mythology saga. save my words this is book which written logically and u can't distracted while reading this. kudos to amish for bringing another mythological saga in terms of ramayana. hats off to you amish. and Amazon as well as for best service.

But I'm still going to pick up the third book with almost the same enthusiasm, as I like the idea of providing a backdoor to all the three main characters before assembling the final showdown, and I'm genuinely interested in how Amish will be handling the extremely strong and enigmatic character of ravana in the next book, and i think he has thrown in a major clue right at the end with regards to what will be coming between raavana and sita.
This book gives a good look at Sita's life right from being an orphan child to her rise to status of a goddess. Language is nice and easy. Characterization is good.
Amazing writing as usual my Amish Tripathi. I have been a fan of Amish's since Immortals of Meluha came out. The day i ordered this book, i binge read all the four books before. In LOVE with his books. Please release Raavan - Orphan of Aryavarta soon.
I found that a little tiresome but maybe it's because it's now almost 20 years since the book came out and the jargon has become more popular. Even if you are not very tech-savvy, you can understand words such as CD-ROM, RAM, hypertext, wireless, etc. I imagine such technical explanation was helpful in the mid-nineties. But, overall, it's a great book.

He has hinted that Ravana is not pure evil, he has good in him.
That being said, this is another of the typical Amish books; the story is engaging, the characters are the usual mixed bunch (some pretty strong while the others forgettable) and the language is pretty straightforward. Go ahead if you like reading the novels of Amish and liked the first Ram Chandra novel.
Awesome Immersive Narration!! Every Scene of mahishmati and Actions mentioned in book seems floating in mind yet and would love to dive again in same world of words in 2nd Part. Only eliminating certain parts (which are to make novel crispier), the book really sets a platform for Bahubali 3.
Got today, completed.two chapters...amazing wish to continue until finish. The way connected with part 1 amazing. Oh the preface of Ravana really creating a buzz.
My recommendation and predictions is skip the current book and the next one too. Read the series from book 4 and come back to 2nd and 3rd after the completion of the series if still interested
Did pre-order received today ,but Sita was missing got a preview copy of Ravan , now who kidnapped Sita this time when Ravan is wid me
I got the book for free luckily under Kindle promotions. Thanks Amazon and thanks Amish, for an enjoyable read.
I wish i had the time spent reading this book back so i could use it for better purposes.  THis book wasted my life.
Plus there is a great shock which is going to be revealed in Raavan --- Orphan of Aryavarta and that is SITA IS THE BIOLOGICAL DAUGHTER OF RAAVAN!!!
As wrote above, Amish has re-introduced Sita but with highlighting evils that are dwelling in our society against the woman. For instance the following conversation between Sunaina and Janak, "Sunaina looked at her husband and smiled as she caressed the baby's head. 'How can anyone abandon a child like her ?' Janak Sighed.

Another epic story by Amish. Received the book today. awesome cover and highly amazed about the preview copy of Raavan : The son of aryavarta. I've read all previous book from Amish and hope this keep the excitement retained after Scion of ikshavaku....finger crossed and hop RSOA is launched soon!!
Worth a read. the narrative keeps you engrossed right uptill the climax, and also keeps you hooked on to the series.
Undoubtedly a great write by Amish, continuing what he left off with the Shiva series this book promises to be a bestseller already.
They have nothing to lose.......But we should not be blind and assume that all poor are noble. Not everyone has the spirit to keep their character strong when their stomachs are angry. " said Sunaina while giving governing lessons to her daughter, Sita.

This novel does not have the research that some of the other Crichton novels have, but it still has a lot of information on random things from the lawes of partial pressure to behavior analysis.
It also has drawn parallels in which Vishnu comes to take care of a society that had tilted it's balance towards feminism and Rudra comes to take care of a society that had tilted balance towards masculinity.

It also has drawn parallels in which Vishnu comes to take care of a society that had tilted it's balance towards feminism and Rudra comes to take care of a society that had tilted balance towards masculinity.
the package was torn but the book and the Raavan's prologue or peek in was in shape. Already excited to commence reading it.
Got it today. Hope it is as good as the first. :D Looking forward to read it.
Now I'm wishing that Paul Attanasio's screenplay had given Dylan Baker the chance to play Phil Blackburn the way the character is portrayed in the novel. It's also entertaining to read the book in 2013 when we've come a long way as far as technology is concerned. I chuckled when the main character, Tom Sanders, had to explain to another character what the internet was and how it worked. Another funny part is when he mentions that the cellular phone is capable of storing up to 200 phone numbers in its memory. The reason why I gave it only 4 stars is simple: there's a lot of technical explanation that goes on for 2-3 pages in a chapter.
Each chapter made me spellbound...Just can't wait for the next book...Curious to know more about the mahishmati secrets...Thank you..Will wait..
amazon.in surprised me with the preview of third book in the series!!too excited!!
Also why a masculine rule was a good solution for today but and evil for tomorrow.
Sphere by Michael Crichton is an excellant novel. This was certainly the hardest to put down of all of the Crichton novels that I have read.
The writing style and content just didn't flow. Wasn't real. I mean, in one section, she actually uses the term "bucko," as in, "Let me tell you something, bucko." What are we in "Happy Days?" Couldn't take the book seriously after that. Very bad.
This book is really worth to be a bestseller......... The story is really fascinating......... Author Amish has not let down our expectations...... But little bit disappointed as I did not get any bookmark from Amazon
I wish i had the time spent reading this book back so i could use it for better purposes.  THis book wasted my life.
Awesome waiting for the next book in line.
Unlike other princesses, Sita was made to study not just science and philosophy but also learned the martial arts and warfare combat. Later Sita was nurtured as the person who will play a crucial role in making India as the brightest nation again. And in her quest to complete her mission, she chose Ram as her partner. Sita ruled with pragmatism while Ram sticked to the laws. In sita, Ram found an "Ardhangini ", a life-partner who wishes to bring the glory to India.
Runs with the Speed of FGFA !!! After the long wait of 2 years, finally yesterday, "Sita - Warrior Of Mithila " was delivered to me ( at 1556 hours ) and I started the book in the late evening and wrapped it in a single sitting. Like the spell bounded the first installment of the Ram Chandra Series, Sita-Warrior of Mithila "reads with the speed tantamount to any fifth-generation fighter jet. The depiction of a woman warrior justifies the title of the book.

Certainly Crichton has covered a wide variety of themes in his writing, or maybe I should say plots, some writers have said there are only seven themes in all writing and I tend to agree given their definitions, but whichever, "Disclosure" is more than just conflict between men and women portrayed by sexual drive and its common viewpoint.
The book describes sita's perspective in a very good manner. Though i felt some parts were similar to the first book of Ram Chandra series. Overall the essence was well captured and overall it intrigues you to know what happens later.
In our urban society, there is a very common myth that poor are usually bad and avaricious people but Amish has bolted some logical words that will make readers understand that why and how, many times, a poor man is forced to be indulged in crime. "The Criminals among the rich are mostly driven by greed.
Lengthy paragraphs...but good work.
Worth a read. the narrative keeps you engrossed right uptill the climax, and also keeps you hooked on to the series.
And please don't make us wait more than one year for your books. All the best!!!!
Awesome is the word to describe Amish' writing style. Blending mythology and fiction and making it app at real as if you have lived it. Fantastic.
How the reverred and worshipped have supported bad to become a hero someday. ? Greed to prove their intelligence ?
This is a very excellent novel with its exhilarating turn of events. The writer gets into each and every minute details of the characters and events so as to give a feeling that we are also a part of this journey. A well planned well said story :)
got this book yesterday[28.05.17]. Rating 5 stars without reading coz i know it wont dissappoint. Even the book cover is so tempting
This book is really worth to be a bestseller......... The story is really fascinating......... Author Amish has not let down our expectations...... But little bit disappointed as I did not get any bookmark from Amazon
the package was torn but the book and the Raavan's prologue or peek in was in shape. Already excited to commence reading it.
Not only do I disagree with his opinions, but some of his facts are blatently false.  On page 106 he refers to violence agains Native Americans by European settlers as "isolated instances" and not planned nor calculated.  Had to read it for a class and it was less then enjoyable.
I hate u Amazon..... Y only 5 stars...... It should have 10 stars.... Completely amazing book.
The book was excellent in the first half but as it intersected with the 1st books , the anticipation and the suspense died for certain parts. The writing style is certainly much better than any of the previous ones and the time that took to write the book was certainly worth it.
But I'm still going to pick up the third book with almost the same enthusiasm, as I like the idea of providing a backdoor to all the three main characters before assembling the final showdown, and I'm genuinely interested in how Amish will be handling the extremely strong and enigmatic character of ravana in the next book, and i think he has thrown in a major clue right at the end with regards to what will be coming between raavana and sita.
Rating it without reading. I know it's a masterpiece. Got my copy today.And already in love with the cover.
Not so good..... The book is moving in a slow pace not as exciting as the shiva trioligy.
Amish is the first author who has made me interested in Indian mythology.I really like the character of SIta portrayed is this book as here she has a much larger role than just being kidnapped by Raavan.The story,narration is really good and there is some light philosophy here and there which I absolute love.
Worth a read. the narrative keeps you engrossed right uptill the climax, and also keeps you hooked on to the series.
The book tries to explain the enigma that is Sivagami. The narrative is impressive as well as gripping. Still one would have expected to have a few more answers like the story behind Bijjala's paralised arm and how he marries Sivagami. The book seems to confuse matters even further as Sivagami is now Mahadeva's love interest. How many more titles before we get all the answers?
Your agent canceled my pre order and now offering 50rs compensation... And advising to order again.. Thank you
its all worth it. best book i have read so far perfect and precise visual effects described through words My speed of reading has increased due to high level of curiosity per chapter. i totally suggest this book for purchase !
I hadn't read anything in a long while. I picked up my Kindle and saw I had downloaded the preliminary pages of Disclosure which allows me to see if an interest is there. I re-read the pages and was immediately captivated. I bought the book, proceeded to read it, skipped dinner, and didn't put it down until The End. Michael Crichton is an amazing and gifted writer; when time allows, which is sparse, he is my go to author after having lost Robert Ludlum. This is a well written novel about a subject fraught with controversy, emotion, and blame, which usually falls in the laps of men. Crichton takes Sexual Harassment to another very compelling level...one in which the reader is stripped of blinders and given a new pair of glasses. Excellent, Michael Crichton!

THis book was horrible.  If it was possible to rate it lower than one star i would have.  I am an avid reader and picked this book up after my mom had gotten it from a friend.  I read half of it, suffering from a headache the entire time, and then got to the part about the relationship the 13 year old boy had with a 33 year old man and i lit this book on fire.  One less copy in the world...don't waste your money.

there is a story with twists n turns weaved with our history. it also builds charachters n importantly with hows and whys
Amazing. Just start reading and get on the beautiful thrilling journey- Sita
Unlike other princesses, Sita was made to study not just science and philosophy but also learned the martial arts and warfare combat. Later Sita was nurtured as the person who will play a crucial role in making India as the brightest nation again. And in her quest to complete her mission, she chose Ram as her partner. Sita ruled with pragmatism while Ram sticked to the laws. In sita, Ram found an "Ardhangini ", a life-partner who wishes to bring the glory to India.
Wonderful narration, true feminism. Sita is not weak but she sometimes adjust to circumstances. As per her school name bhoomi, my guess is that she is the one who founded panchavati in Amish Shiva trilogy, bhumi Devi of naga's. It could be Amish way of traditional ramayana in which Rama and sita stay away once sita is pregnant and for good
Got today, completed.two chapters...amazing wish to continue until finish. The way connected with part 1 amazing. Oh the preface of Ravana really creating a buzz.
Certainly Crichton has covered a wide variety of themes in his writing, or maybe I should say plots, some writers have said there are only seven themes in all writing and I tend to agree given their definitions, but whichever, "Disclosure" is more than just conflict between men and women portrayed by sexual drive and its common viewpoint.

After Naga series,Ram Chandra series too has proved the aforesaid.
The most gorgeous artwork in comic books. Contains the most extraordinary artwork of Alex Ross(Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman,  the Justice League, etc, even Hanna-Barbera!) A comics fan, I recieved this as a Christmas gift, and I read it again and again. A must-have for comic book fans.

Did pre-order received today ,but Sita was missing got a preview copy of Ravan , now who kidnapped Sita this time when Ravan is wid me
He has hinted that Ravana is not pure evil, he has good in him.
In our urban society, there is a very common myth that poor are usually bad and avaricious people but Amish has bolted some logical words that will make readers understand that why and how, many times, a poor man is forced to be indulged in crime. "The Criminals among the rich are mostly driven by greed.
Will update the review as I read the book but I don't think that the stars will come down from 5!
Note to others: You need not have read Scion of Ikshvaku to read Sita (though I loved the previous part too). So if you are planning to just read this one, you can start from here.
Looking forward to complete the book...i will love it as always loved Amish's writing.
One thing that was super disappointing was "NO BOOKMARK". The only reason for the reduction of the rating!
Certainly Crichton has covered a wide variety of themes in his writing, or maybe I should say plots, some writers have said there are only seven themes in all writing and I tend to agree given their definitions, but whichever, "Disclosure" is more than just conflict between men and women portrayed by sexual drive and its common viewpoint.
When I want to read a historical fiction, I would want the contemporary influence to be as minimal as possible, if at all there is any it should be really subtle.
I picked up the first book in this series (The Eyre Affair) based purely on its premise and was left somewhat underwhelmed. Still, the potential for the series seemed so large that I went ahead and read this second one too, only to be even less enchanted with the franchise. This is a pure sequel, and any newcomers are advised to read the misadventures of Thursday Next is strict order, lest one miss out of allusions to past events. Although... on further consideration, maybe it doesn't matter, since clearly anything can and will happen in this series, and Fforde isn't all that interested in keeping to a linear plotline anyway.
I already give it a 5 star
It is a power struggle with a happy ending(my terminology) if the protagonist has aroused empathy with the reader who may not be maleand hence predisposed, as related in the novel, to view men as always the predator, women as the victim and role reversal is unbelievable.
No party of society can be ignored. Army, business , the poor , the rich all are a part of society and if anyone one is ignored the society will fall.
Even though it is not a sequel of the frist book ,it is very good. Hoping the next book will not take 2 years
But I'm still going to pick up the third book with almost the same enthusiasm, as I like the idea of providing a backdoor to all the three main characters before assembling the final showdown, and I'm genuinely interested in how Amish will be handling the extremely strong and enigmatic character of ravana in the next book, and i think he has thrown in a major clue right at the end with regards to what will be coming between raavana and sita.
The imagination the story brings is multifold compared to what is shown in both the Bahubali movies. It is a must read for all Bahubali fans across the globe. Totally up for grabs.
My sister bought it for me. Got it on Monday. Looking forward to read it. I was expecting cool bookmark with book art but didn't get one.
This is a very excellent novel with its exhilarating turn of events. The writer gets into each and every minute details of the characters and events so as to give a feeling that we are also a part of this journey. A well planned well said story :)
I have picked up this book after reading the first book in the Ramachandra series. However I should say this book has not lived up to the benchmark set by the previous book. I love Amish's story telling technique and the way he builds the characters. When I read "Scion of Ikshvaku", I fell in love with Lakshman, Ram, Sita, Jatayu and others. When I read "Sita - Warrior of Mithila", I fell in love with Sunaina and fell for Jatayu again.
Loved it.. really proud of being INDIAN..our history rocks.. hats off to Amish for such a wonderful book..keep it up..looking forward for more such gems..
Lets wait for the book from Raavans point of view
My sister bought it for me. Got it on Monday. Looking forward to read it. I was expecting cool bookmark with book art but didn't get one.
Well you do slightly begin to lose interest after the 225th page. The only new chapter in the book after the 200th page which has not been adopted from scion of ikshvaku is the one about vali. Otherwise every thing is the same. Even the preview book of raavan does not build up much curiosity. I am excited about the book on Raavan because first time I will read a book with an insight in Raavans life. Sita is perfect only up till the 215th page. It deteriorates a bit but it is bearable.

Attention!!!! Sita is Vishu.....and the demons know about that.
The story revolves around a man named Norman Johnson. Johnson is a phycologist. He travels with 4 other civilans to a remote location in the Pacific Ocean to help the Navy in a top secret misssion. They quickly learn that under the ocean is a half mile long spaceship. The civilans travel to a center 1000 feet under the ocean to live while researching the spacecraft. They are joined by 5 Navy personel to help them run operations. However on the surface a typhoon comes and the support ships on the surface must leave. The team of ten is stuck 1000 feet under the surface of the ocean. After a day under the sea they find out that the spacecraft is actually an American ship that has explored black holes and has brought back some strange things back to earth.
And just for a moment, as soon as I opened the cover, I thought I stuck gold where due to a mistake by a Amazon I received the book 3 Raavana. But that didn't last long as it was just a promotional addition.
amazon.in surprised me with the preview of third book in the series!!too excited!!
its all worth it. best book i have read so far perfect and precise visual effects described through words My speed of reading has increased due to high level of curiosity per chapter. i totally suggest this book for purchase !
This was an outstanding read and very well written as can be expected for a Michael Crighton book. I think this was one of the better books I've read. The plot was well crafted and developed, and the subject matter is so thoroughly interesting and fascinating. Perhaps the most amazing aspect of the book is how Crighton writes about virtual reality and what eventually came to be Ipad devices technologies in such a prescient and eerily accurate way 25 years before these technologies were implemented. I never cease to be amazed by the genius who was Michael Crighton.
I have not received any type of phone call for the expected delivery of the novel- Sits the warrior of mithila even though I received the message of its delivery date. And it is quite frustrating when it happens two times in a row. Hope you will take some necessary actions.
One can negotiate with greed. But the criminals among the poor are driven by desperation and anger. Desperation can sometimes bring out the best in a human being. That's why the poor can often be noble. But desperation can also bring out the worst.
Got it today. Hope it is as good as the first. :D Looking forward to read it.

It gave 5 shocks in the first chapter itself Shock 1: Sita is a Vishnu (The is also a clue about this in the last paragraph of Scion of Ikshvaku) Shock 2: Sita knows she is a Vishnu Shock 3: Jatayu was previously a Lankan and was loyal to Raavan (This clue is also mentioned in the last chapter of Scion of Ikshvaku) Shock 4: The Lankans also know that Sita is a Vishnu Shock 5: The Lankans knew Sita since her childhood and she also had a memory of the Lankan captain Khar from her distant past
Completed three chapters, so good so far!!! And the little Sita in the second chapter looking so cuteðŸ˜˜ðŸ˜˜ 'sleeping like angel'
The writing style and content just didn't flow. Wasn't real. I mean, in one section, she actually uses the term "bucko," as in, "Let me tell you something, bucko." What are we in "Happy Days?" Couldn't take the book seriously after that. Very bad.
got this book yesterday[28.05.17]. Rating 5 stars without reading coz i know it wont dissappoint. Even the book cover is so tempting
Better than scion of ikshvaku, but still not that good

didn't start yet but one thing amish books are amazing for that I'm sure really loved the packing from Amazon and the Ravaan first cover was like Superb eagerly waiting for that and the final book
I found that a little tiresome but maybe it's because it's now almost 20 years since the book came out and the jargon has become more popular. Even if you are not very tech-savvy, you can understand words such as CD-ROM, RAM, hypertext, wireless, etc. I imagine such technical explanation was helpful in the mid-nineties. But, overall, it's a great book.
How the two most important and intelligent clans can be right and wrong at the same time.
Awesome book with great twists and gripping style. Worth my reading time.

It has answers for why Somras was distributed freely among sooryavnshi.
Fast Delivery and Awesome product quality !!!
The book is just amazing. I completed it in one day. The part 3 coming in 2018, i am e agerly waiting for it. Waiting for 2 years was worthwhile
I hate u Amazon..... Y only 5 stars...... It should have 10 stars.... Completely amazing book.

Subsequent floods had changed the course of river Gandaki, which earlier flows from Mithila, and the rains also failed which caused huge economic damage to Mithila. But Mithila's loss was Sankashya's gain. Mithila was ruled by a devout and spiritual man named Janak who's married to a pragmatic woman Sunaina while the kingdom of Sankashya was ruled by Janak's younger brother Kushadhwaj. But the woes like rainfall-failure makes the Kushadhwaj rose in stature as the de facto representative of the clan of Mithi.
Dr. Oz is an accomplished heart surgeon in the field of cardiac transplantation. He describes how he combines complementary medicine (e.g. hypnosis, reflexology, yoga, message, acupuncture. Etc) with orthodox Western medicine. There is an excellent forward by Dr Dean Ornish, and an interesting epilogue containing an overview of the complementary medicine techniques. The bulk of the book contains stories of patients Dr. Oz treated using this revolutionary way. I am a cardiologist, and I have a great interest in combining western medicine with complementary medicine, which is the reason I bought this book. However this book was a bit boring to read and was also a bit of a disappointment. Nevertheless, those interested in this new medicine, which I think will be the medicine of the new millennium, will want to read this book.
Plus there is a great shock which is going to be revealed in Raavan --- Orphan of Aryavarta and that is SITA IS THE BIOLOGICAL DAUGHTER OF RAAVAN!!!
My sister bought it for me. Got it on Monday. Looking forward to read it. I was expecting cool bookmark with book art but didn't get one.

That being said, this is another of the typical Amish books; the story is engaging, the characters are the usual mixed bunch (some pretty strong while the others forgettable) and the language is pretty straightforward. Go ahead if you like reading the novels of Amish and liked the first Ram Chandra novel.
Another epic story by Amish. Received the book today. awesome cover and highly amazed about the preview copy of Raavan : The son of aryavarta. I've read all previous book from Amish and hope this keep the excitement retained after Scion of ikshavaku....finger crossed and hop RSOA is launched soon!!
Did pre-order received today ,but Sita was missing got a preview copy of Ravan , now who kidnapped Sita this time when Ravan is wid me
I already give it a 5 star
The imagination the story brings is multifold compared to what is shown in both the Bahubali movies. It is a must read for all Bahubali fans across the globe. Totally up for grabs.
No words for this awesome author. Book was really great.
Not only do I disagree with his opinions, but some of his facts are blatently false.  On page 106 he refers to violence agains Native Americans by European settlers as "isolated instances" and not planned nor calculated.  Had to read it for a class and it was less then enjoyable.
Undoubtedly a great write by Amish, continuing what he left off with the Shiva series this book promises to be a bestseller already.
amazon.in surprised me with the preview of third book in the series!!too excited!!
Interesting world created by the author good work of fiction. Will be interesting to see how the author handles shambhok
Shiva trilogy was a new story so it had its suspense. Ramachandra Series is a well known story, so it has its difficulties in creating suspense.
The book tries to explain the enigma that is Sivagami. The narrative is impressive as well as gripping. Still one would have expected to have a few more answers like the story behind Bijjala's paralised arm and how he marries Sivagami. The book seems to confuse matters even further as Sivagami is now Mahadeva's love interest. How many more titles before we get all the answers?
Since it is the fight for CD usage that is one of the key points in the story and with the female antagonist trying to ruin Tom Sanders over his use of the CD as storage it is a shame that production is the battleground, not fact that one form of storage is inherently better than the other. It is Meredith's knuckling under to Malaysian pressure to increase use of local labor and not use machines that has to be proven, getting away from the science of magnetic devices.
Amish is the first author who has made me interested in Indian mythology.I really like the character of SIta portrayed is this book as here she has a much larger role than just being kidnapped by Raavan.The story,narration is really good and there is some light philosophy here and there which I absolute love.
Your agent canceled my pre order and now offering 50rs compensation... And advising to order again.. Thank you
The book was ok..after 200 pages story loses momentum...still looking forward to the next book on Ravana
Just came back from mahishmathi kingdom Waiting to enter again in next part
didn't start yet but one thing amish books are amazing for that I'm sure really loved the packing from Amazon and the Ravaan first cover was like Superb eagerly waiting for that and the final book

I loved the movie and enjoyed the book. I love how it goes deeper into office politics and all the backstabbing games. The reason for the set up against the main character makes more sense than it did in the movie. The movie implies that Meredith Johnson did what she did because she was a scorned lover. The book takes a slightly different approach. Sure, that was one of the reasons but there was so much more going on and she was not alone in her plight to destroy Tom Sanders.
Got the book today(29.5.17). The cover page is awesome! But I'm always disappointed with the inner page quality and also haven't got any good page marker(metal) like before when I pre-ordered another series of Amish. Anyway,I'm a big fan of what Amish Sir delivers through his writtings...I hope this one will also give satisfaction. And I liked the surprise! Advertisement of book 3!
This book gives a good look at Sita's life right from being an orphan child to her rise to status of a goddess. Language is nice and easy. Characterization is good.
Interesting world created by the author good work of fiction. Will be interesting to see how the author handles shambhok
But that's okay.....worth waiting.
Fast paced, breath taking and nail biting till the last page...
Dr. Oz is an accomplished heart surgeon in the field of cardiac transplantation. He describes how he combines complementary medicine (e.g. hypnosis, reflexology, yoga, message, acupuncture. Etc) with orthodox Western medicine. There is an excellent forward by Dr Dean Ornish, and an interesting epilogue containing an overview of the complementary medicine techniques. The bulk of the book contains stories of patients Dr. Oz treated using this revolutionary way. I am a cardiologist, and I have a great interest in combining western medicine with complementary medicine, which is the reason I bought this book. However this book was a bit boring to read and was also a bit of a disappointment. Nevertheless, those interested in this new medicine, which I think will be the medicine of the new millennium, will want to read this book.
My sister bought it for me. Got it on Monday. Looking forward to read it. I was expecting cool bookmark with book art but didn't get one.
Excellent and strong portrayal of lady Sita's point of view. Can't wait for the next book to be released. Totally immersive!
While the first two books of Meluha series were truly captivating, author seems to have succumbed to commercial instincts. Two editions in this series have not been as enjoyable
P.S: The next book will also be similar to this, told from the perspective of Raavan, who, if the clues are to be believed, is different from the stereotype evil tyrant (one can always hope).
Loved it.. really proud of being INDIAN..our history rocks.. hats off to Amish for such a wonderful book..keep it up..looking forward for more such gems..
amazing book just recieved it today morning and completed reading also the part 3 preview is amazing.the only thing I hate amish is as he always keep a me waiting .thnx my favourite author.awaiting it next 2 masterpieces.
I must say "The read was much more than its worth"
Fast paced, breath taking and nail biting till the last page...
Great work by Amish Exciting book Got it today. Also received a bookmark . Thanks Amazon
I must say "The read was much more than its worth"
its all worth it. best book i have read so far perfect and precise visual effects described through words My speed of reading has increased due to high level of curiosity per chapter. i totally suggest this book for purchase !
THis book was horrible.  If it was possible to rate it lower than one star i would have.  I am an avid reader and picked this book up after my mom had gotten it from a friend.  I read half of it, suffering from a headache the entire time, and then got to the part about the relationship the 13 year old boy had with a 33 year old man and i lit this book on fire.  One less copy in the world...don't waste your money.
It should not be surprising to find that there is a high load of suspense in trying to find fault, especially since the president of the company is backing the woman. Again, I recommend reading the book to get the full enjoyment of the twists and turns used by Meredith to win top dog position.
And just for a moment, as soon as I opened the cover, I thought I stuck gold where due to a mistake by a Amazon I received the book 3 Raavana. But that didn't last long as it was just a promotional addition.
Instead of Sits , I was given Raavan the third book of Ram Chandra series
Amazing story telling from a different point of view. What if it actually was true? As always hungry for Ravaan
Amish Tripathi is indeed the best writer in India in the recent time.
I like to use the Amazon reviews when purchasing books, especially alert for dissenting perceptions about higly rated items, which usually disuades me from a selection.  So I offer this review that seriously questions the popularity of this work - I found it smug, self-serving and self-indulgent, written by a person with little or no empathy, especially for the people he castigates. For example, his portrayal of the family therapist seems implausible and reaches for effect and panders to the "shrink" bashers of the world. This "play for effect" tone throughout the book was very distasteful to me.
This is Aryan I forget to eat food today ....indulged in divine journey of seeta....amazing... And after a long wait ...its worth reading
I have received a wrong book. I have not received SITA - Warrior of Mithila.
Just came back from mahishmathi kingdom Waiting to enter again in next part
This book gives a good look at Sita's life right from being an orphan child to her rise to status of a goddess. Language is nice and easy. Characterization is good.
The most gorgeous artwork in comic books. Contains the most extraordinary artwork of Alex Ross(Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman,  the Justice League, etc, even Hanna-Barbera!) A comics fan, I recieved this as a Christmas gift, and I read it again and again. A must-have for comic book fans.
Awesome is the word to describe Amish' writing style. Blending mythology and fiction and making it app at real as if you have lived it. Fantastic.
good price and excellent delivery.

Did pre-order received today ,but Sita was missing got a preview copy of Ravan , now who kidnapped Sita this time when Ravan is wid me
The book will be a nice collection for a book lover with the addition of the other two issues .The story is really nice and there was not a single page where I felt bored and I did not know when I came to the last part of the book and I am really eager what is in store in the next issues. It contains adult related writing so it is not for children.
Got a pre ordered copy today ans just completed the 1st chapter of this epic mythology saga. save my words this is book which written logically and u can't distracted while reading this. kudos to amish for bringing another mythological saga in terms of ramayana. hats off to you amish. and Amazon as well as for best service.
Amish is really sorry for the delay, yes!!! Look in to the book.

Attention!!!! Sita is Vishu.....and the demons know about that.
Amish tries some of the usual tricks of weaving too much of contemporary politics and events. They was a wow in Meluha when we read this for the first time but not here. Nothing can beat the need for a story and may be a new bag of tricks
its all worth it. best book i have read so far perfect and precise visual effects described through words My speed of reading has increased due to high level of curiosity per chapter. i totally suggest this book for purchase !
Well I like the first book of the Ram Chandra Series and waited a frickin more than 1 and a half year for the second part. So as soon as I saw that prr booking offer I just placed it. And boy I loved this book ( not as much as the first book). But now today on 2nd of June I saw that PayTm is selling the same book at way cheaper price, I'm confused whether it was good choice pre ordering a book or should have waited for few days and bought it from PayTm. Thoughts anyone?
The book was excellent in the first half but as it intersected with the 1st books , the anticipation and the suspense died for certain parts. The writing style is certainly much better than any of the previous ones and the time that took to write the book was certainly worth it.
Better than scion of ikshvaku, but still not that good
This is Aryan I forget to eat food today ....indulged in divine journey of seeta....amazing... And after a long wait ...its worth reading
This is my second favorite Crichton book after Jurassic Park. It starts off slow (like the first 50 pages) but once it gets going, it GOES. You really end up hating Meredith and rooting for Sanders to prevail.
The story of a woman whose name is taken as the ideal role model for all women in India. The book has indeed done justice to the character of Sita. I loved seeing Sita as the one who takes charge, crafts her own destiny (and those who she loves!), strategises and executes each of her plans. A must read just for those who want to admire the completeness of her character.
Certainly Crichton has covered a wide variety of themes in his writing, or maybe I should say plots, some writers have said there are only seven themes in all writing and I tend to agree given their definitions, but whichever, "Disclosure" is more than just conflict between men and women portrayed by sexual drive and its common viewpoint.
Sphere by Michael Crichton is an excellant novel. This was certainly the hardest to put down of all of the Crichton novels that I have read.
The book tries to explain the enigma that is Sivagami. The narrative is impressive as well as gripping. Still one would have expected to have a few more answers like the story behind Bijjala's paralised arm and how he marries Sivagami. The book seems to confuse matters even further as Sivagami is now Mahadeva's love interest. How many more titles before we get all the answers?
THis book was horrible.  If it was possible to rate it lower than one star i would have.  I am an avid reader and picked this book up after my mom had gotten it from a friend.  I read half of it, suffering from a headache the entire time, and then got to the part about the relationship the 13 year old boy had with a 33 year old man and i lit this book on fire.  One less copy in the world...don't waste your money.
delivered on my birthday so happy..
The best book, but Why there is no preview chapter of 3rd book Raavana of Rama Series in kindle version of eBook?
No words for this awesome author. Book was really great.
I was also wondering how will Amish introduce the process of "churning" Somras. Agatsyakootam and the river was brilliant(if i am correct).
Very good creativity by Amish, a lot of political wisdom thrown into the book. Awesome. Amish has yet again proved his mantle.

When I want to read a historical fiction, I would want the contemporary influence to be as minimal as possible, if at all there is any it should be really subtle.

Looking forward to complete the book...i will love it as always loved Amish's writing.
It's a great book worth reading waiting for Raavan .... Can't wait more
Even though it is not a sequel of the frist book ,it is very good. Hoping the next book will not take 2 years

'Many people are not wise enough to count life's blessings. They keep focusing instead on what the world has denied them.'-Janak, when they found Sita.
He has hinted that Ravana is not pure evil, he has good in him.
This is Aryan I forget to eat food today ....indulged in divine journey of seeta....amazing... And after a long wait ...its worth reading
Awesome Immersive Narration!! Every Scene of mahishmati and Actions mentioned in book seems floating in mind yet and would love to dive again in same world of words in 2nd Part. Only eliminating certain parts (which are to make novel crispier), the book really sets a platform for Bahubali 3.
I was also wondering how will Amish introduce the process of "churning" Somras. Agatsyakootam and the river was brilliant(if i am correct).
The story is riveting and takes pace from where it stood in the first part. The highlight of the book is how Amish has the skill of tweaking Ramayana to his brilliant convenience keeping the base storyline same. The turns and surprises can be best enjoyed after reading The Scion of Ikshvaku and then picking up The warrior of Mithila. Needless to say, Sita is gloriously portrayed as never before.
there is a story with twists n turns weaved with our history. it also builds charachters n importantly with hows and whys
I already give it a 5 star
Just came back from mahishmathi kingdom Waiting to enter again in next part
Book is more about philosophies than detailed warfare and unknown plots.
Just came back from mahishmathi kingdom Waiting to enter again in next part
I have not received any type of phone call for the expected delivery of the novel- Sits the warrior of mithila even though I received the message of its delivery date. And it is quite frustrating when it happens two times in a row. Hope you will take some necessary actions.

Plus there is a great shock which is going to be revealed in Raavan --- Orphan of Aryavarta and that is SITA IS THE BIOLOGICAL DAUGHTER OF RAAVAN!!!
Even though it is not a sequel of the frist book ,it is very good. Hoping the next book will not take 2 years
First of all i am a big fan of amish sir and i had read all the books he had written. I have received my order today and i am excited to read it. I know that this book is also going to be blockbuster.
I hate u Amazon..... Y only 5 stars...... It should have 10 stars.... Completely amazing book.
Not only do I disagree with his opinions, but some of his facts are blatently false.  On page 106 he refers to violence agains Native Americans by European settlers as "isolated instances" and not planned nor calculated.  Had to read it for a class and it was less then enjoyable.
I wish i had the time spent reading this book back so i could use it for better purposes.  THis book wasted my life.
'Many People are not wise enough to count life's blessing. They keep focusing instead on what the world has denied them '", depicts the unfortunate truth of Indian societies in which Girl child are abandoned. Although many women have achieved what men failed to but in some societies girl child is still considered as an ill omen and Amish has rightly depicted how a girl child is a blessing.Apart from raising the tacit issue that Woman should be treated equally, Amish has bolted anecdotes that remind the citizens of their individual duties towards the Nation.
It should not be surprising to find that there is a high load of suspense in trying to find fault, especially since the president of the company is backing the woman. Again, I recommend reading the book to get the full enjoyment of the twists and turns used by Meredith to win top dog position.

Undoubtedly a great write by Amish, continuing what he left off with the Shiva series this book promises to be a bestseller already.
In our urban society, there is a very common myth that poor are usually bad and avaricious people but Amish has bolted some logical words that will make readers understand that why and how, many times, a poor man is forced to be indulged in crime. "The Criminals among the rich are mostly driven by greed.
It has answers for why Somras was distributed freely among sooryavnshi.
Very good creativity by Amish, a lot of political wisdom thrown into the book. Awesome. Amish has yet again proved his mantle.
P.S: The next book will also be similar to this, told from the perspective of Raavan, who, if the clues are to be believed, is different from the stereotype evil tyrant (one can always hope).
Runs with the Speed of FGFA !!! After the long wait of 2 years, finally yesterday, "Sita - Warrior Of Mithila " was delivered to me ( at 1556 hours ) and I started the book in the late evening and wrapped it in a single sitting. Like the spell bounded the first installment of the Ram Chandra Series, Sita-Warrior of Mithila "reads with the speed tantamount to any fifth-generation fighter jet. The depiction of a woman warrior justifies the title of the book.
Had pre-ordered the book. Got it today. Too excited to start this new journey of Amish's imagination! The cover of the sneak preview book of the third book, "Raavan" looks amaziiiiinng!
I have received a wrong book. I have not received SITA - Warrior of Mithila.
Not only do I disagree with his opinions, but some of his facts are blatently false.  On page 106 he refers to violence agains Native Americans by European settlers as "isolated instances" and not planned nor calculated.  Had to read it for a class and it was less then enjoyable.

Completed reading the book. The perspective of Ramayana from Sita's point of view till her capture is really interesting but the narrative lagged the excitement of the previous books. Nevertheless, it has it's moments and the Baahubali like climax is interesting.
I always thought that nothing could be better than Shiva Trilogy, but I was wrong. Mr. Tripathi has let us explore that world, in more depth, which he introduced us in Shiva Trilogy. Sita - The Warrior Of Mithila has become a source of power for me. Trust me, you can't afford to miss this one. love, Laughter and Peace

This is book is the fiction story of the author, who does not know have the basic knowledge of Ramayan, his book is far from reality & he is misguiding about the role of Mother Sita. Extremely disappointed
Attention!!!! Sita is Vishu.....and the demons know about that.
Undoubtedly a great write by Amish, continuing what he left off with the Shiva series this book promises to be a bestseller already.
Loved it.. really proud of being INDIAN..our history rocks.. hats off to Amish for such a wonderful book..keep it up..looking forward for more such gems..
I got the book for free luckily under Kindle promotions. Thanks Amazon and thanks Amish, for an enjoyable read.

I hadn't read anything in a long while. I picked up my Kindle and saw I had downloaded the preliminary pages of Disclosure which allows me to see if an interest is there. I re-read the pages and was immediately captivated. I bought the book, proceeded to read it, skipped dinner, and didn't put it down until The End. Michael Crichton is an amazing and gifted writer; when time allows, which is sparse, he is my go to author after having lost Robert Ludlum. This is a well written novel about a subject fraught with controversy, emotion, and blame, which usually falls in the laps of men. Crichton takes Sexual Harassment to another very compelling level...one in which the reader is stripped of blinders and given a new pair of glasses. Excellent, Michael Crichton!
Bitter relation of Vashishta & Vishwamitra, as well, keep the plot completely gripping part from the philosophical talks that are mentioned above.

Nevertheless a good read. Looking forward to next.
Considering everyone knows the basic storyline of Ramayana, the book still has interesting philosophies in it.

Well you do slightly begin to lose interest after the 225th page. The only new chapter in the book after the 200th page which has not been adopted from scion of ikshvaku is the one about vali. Otherwise every thing is the same. Even the preview book of raavan does not build up much curiosity. I am excited about the book on Raavan because first time I will read a book with an insight in Raavans life. Sita is perfect only up till the 215th page. It deteriorates a bit but it is bearable.

didn't start yet but one thing amish books are amazing for that I'm sure really loved the packing from Amazon and the Ravaan first cover was like Superb eagerly waiting for that and the final book
Instead of Sits , I was given Raavan the third book of Ram Chandra series
I am not sure who's writing these reviews, but I read repitition after repitition after repitition, with a lot of confusing fluff. Asking hard questions to solve complex or simple issues. What's "fierce" about that?
Sita the warrior princes continues to project the lacunae in Amish's craft... The failure to create a different world and drawing continuing parallels with current India irritates.. Ofcourse its a fast read of the quintessential Amish genre and the story is definitely interesting... Alas... the devil in the details disappoints agai
Got it today. Hope it is as good as the first. :D Looking forward to read it.
Subsequent floods had changed the course of river Gandaki, which earlier flows from Mithila, and the rains also failed which caused huge economic damage to Mithila. But Mithila's loss was Sankashya's gain. Mithila was ruled by a devout and spiritual man named Janak who's married to a pragmatic woman Sunaina while the kingdom of Sankashya was ruled by Janak's younger brother Kushadhwaj. But the woes like rainfall-failure makes the Kushadhwaj rose in stature as the de facto representative of the clan of Mithi.
The story revolves around a man named Norman Johnson. Johnson is a phycologist. He travels with 4 other civilans to a remote location in the Pacific Ocean to help the Navy in a top secret misssion. They quickly learn that under the ocean is a half mile long spaceship. The civilans travel to a center 1000 feet under the ocean to live while researching the spacecraft. They are joined by 5 Navy personel to help them run operations. However on the surface a typhoon comes and the support ships on the surface must leave. The team of ten is stuck 1000 feet under the surface of the ocean. After a day under the sea they find out that the spacecraft is actually an American ship that has explored black holes and has brought back some strange things back to earth.
Considering everyone knows the basic storyline of Ramayana, the book still has interesting philosophies in it.
The book was ok..after 200 pages story loses momentum...still looking forward to the next book on Ravana
Only thing g required is to stop attaching present situations too much.. otherwise a great stuff .
Your agent canceled my pre order and now offering 50rs compensation... And advising to order again.. Thank you
Awesome is the word to describe Amish' writing style. Blending mythology and fiction and making it app at real as if you have lived it. Fantastic.

This book gives a good look at Sita's life right from being an orphan child to her rise to status of a goddess. Language is nice and easy. Characterization is good.
amazing book just recieved it today morning and completed reading also the part 3 preview is amazing.the only thing I hate amish is as he always keep a me waiting .thnx my favourite author.awaiting it next 2 masterpieces.
The book will be a nice collection for a book lover with the addition of the other two issues .The story is really nice and there was not a single page where I felt bored and I did not know when I came to the last part of the book and I am really eager what is in store in the next issues.

Hehe...one more thing....Hanu bhaiya is also here.
Amish tries some of the usual tricks of weaving too much of contemporary politics and events. They was a wow in Meluha when we read this for the first time but not here. Nothing can beat the need for a story and may be a new bag of tricks
Great story waiting for second part
This is book is the fiction story of the author, who does not know have the basic knowledge of Ramayan, his book is far from reality & he is misguiding about the role of Mother Sita. Extremely disappointed
Amish is the first author who has made me interested in Indian mythology.I really like the character of SIta portrayed is this book as here she has a much larger role than just being kidnapped by Raavan.The story,narration is really good and there is some light philosophy here and there which I absolute love.
How the two most important and intelligent clans can be right and wrong at the same time.
THis book was horrible.  If it was possible to rate it lower than one star i would have.  I am an avid reader and picked this book up after my mom had gotten it from a friend.  I read half of it, suffering from a headache the entire time, and then got to the part about the relationship the 13 year old boy had with a 33 year old man and i lit this book on fire.  One less copy in the world...don't waste your money.

Amazing book!!! But only one thing, in the past whenever i ordered some book i used to get a bookmark with every book but with the last 21 books I haven't got any..!!! Opening the package and looking at that cute bookmark was one joy thing..!! I think and hope with next book i'll get it!!!
Had pre-ordered the book. Got it today. Too excited to start this new journey of Amish's imagination! The cover of the sneak preview book of the third book, "Raavan" looks amaziiiiinng!
But I'm still going to pick up the third book with almost the same enthusiasm, as I like the idea of providing a backdoor to all the three main characters before assembling the final showdown, and I'm genuinely interested in how Amish will be handling the extremely strong and enigmatic character of ravana in the next book, and i think he has thrown in a major clue right at the end with regards to what will be coming between raavana and sita.
I must say "The read was much more than its worth"
Great story waiting for second part
Worth a read. the narrative keeps you engrossed right uptill the climax, and also keeps you hooked on to the series.
If you have read "Scion of Ikshvaku", you can read half of the book and then gently ignore the remaining chapters and move on to the last one. Amish should have written this book in 180-200 pages at the most, there is lot of repetition from the first part, not just scenes but chapters together. He should have avoided this and made this book more gripping.
Also why a masculine rule was a good solution for today but and evil for tomorrow.
Excellence writing once again by Amish, Sitamata ki jai Jai Shri Ram
The writing style and content just didn't flow. Wasn't real. I mean, in one section, she actually uses the term "bucko," as in, "Let me tell you something, bucko." What are we in "Happy Days?" Couldn't take the book seriously after that. Very bad.
This novel does not have the research that some of the other Crichton novels have, but it still has a lot of information on random things from the lawes of partial pressure to behavior analysis.
Lengthy paragraphs...but good work.
The book will be a nice collection for a book lover with the addition of the other two issues .The story is really nice and there was not a single page where I felt bored and I did not know when I came to the last part of the book and I am really eager what is in store in the next issues. It contains adult related writing so it is not for children.
Got today, completed.two chapters...amazing wish to continue until finish. The way connected with part 1 amazing. Oh the preface of Ravana really creating a buzz.
No words for this awesome author. Book was really great.
I like to use the Amazon reviews when purchasing books, especially alert for dissenting perceptions about higly rated items, which usually disuades me from a selection.  So I offer this review that seriously questions the popularity of this work - I found it smug, self-serving and self-indulgent, written by a person with little or no empathy, especially for the people he castigates. For example, his portrayal of the family therapist seems implausible and reaches for effect and panders to the "shrink" bashers of the world. This "play for effect" tone throughout the book was very distasteful to me.
It should not be surprising to find that there is a high load of suspense in trying to find fault, especially since the president of the company is backing the woman. Again, I recommend reading the book to get the full enjoyment of the twists and turns used by Meredith to win top dog position.
How the two most important and intelligent clans can be right and wrong at the same time.

Dr. Oz is an accomplished heart surgeon in the field of cardiac transplantation. He describes how he combines complementary medicine (e.g. hypnosis, reflexology, yoga, message, acupuncture. Etc) with orthodox Western medicine. There is an excellent forward by Dr Dean Ornish, and an interesting epilogue containing an overview of the complementary medicine techniques. The bulk of the book contains stories of patients Dr. Oz treated using this revolutionary way. I am a cardiologist, and I have a great interest in combining western medicine with complementary medicine, which is the reason I bought this book. However this book was a bit boring to read and was also a bit of a disappointment. Nevertheless, those interested in this new medicine, which I think will be the medicine of the new millennium, will want to read this book.
Sphere by Michael Crichton is an excellant novel. This was certainly the hardest to put down of all of the Crichton novels that I have read. 
The story revolves around a man named Norman Johnson. Johnson is a phycologist. He travels with 4 other civilans to a remote location in the Pacific Ocean to help the Navy in a top secret misssion. They quickly learn that under the ocean is a half mile long spaceship. The civilans travel to a center 1000 feet under the ocean to live while researching the spacecraft. They are joined by 5 Navy personel to help them run operations. However on the surface a typhoon comes and the support ships on the surface must leave. The team of ten is stuck 1000 feet under the surface of the ocean. After a day under the sea they find out that the spacecraft is actually an American ship that has explored black holes and has brought back some strange things back to earth.

THis book was horrible.  If it was possible to rate it lower than one star i would have.  I am an avid reader and picked this book up after my mom had gotten it from a friend.  I read half of it, suffering from a headache the entire time, and then got to the part about the relationship the 13 year old boy had with a 33 year old man and i lit this book on fire.  One less copy in the world...don't waste your money.
I wish i had the time spent reading this book back so i could use it for better purposes.  THis book wasted my life.

I am not sure who's writing these reviews, but I read repitition after repitition after repitition, with a lot of confusing fluff. Asking hard questions to solve complex or simple issues. What's "fierce" about that?

The most gorgeous artwork in comic books. Contains the most extraordinary artwork of Alex Ross(Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman,  the Justice League, etc, even Hanna-Barbera!) A comics fan, I recieved this as a Christmas gift, and I read it again and again. A must-have for comic book fans.
I picked up the first book in this series (The Eyre Affair) based purely on its premise and was left somewhat underwhelmed. Still, the potential for the series seemed so large that I went ahead and read this second one too, only to be even less enchanted with the franchise. This is a pure sequel, and any newcomers are advised to read the misadventures of Thursday Next is strict order, lest one miss out of allusions to past events. Although... on further consideration, maybe it doesn't matter, since clearly anything can and will happen in this series, and Fforde isn't all that interested in keeping to a linear plotline anyway.
Not only do I disagree with his opinions, but some of his facts are blatently false.  On page 106 he refers to violence agains Native Americans by European settlers as "isolated instances" and not planned nor calculated.  Had to read it for a class and it was less then enjoyable.
This was an outstanding read and very well written as can be expected for a Michael Crighton book. I think this was one of the better books I've read. The plot was well crafted and developed, and the subject matter is so thoroughly interesting and fascinating. Perhaps the most amazing aspect of the book is how Crighton writes about virtual reality and what eventually came to be Ipad devices technologies in such a prescient and eerily accurate way 25 years before these technologies were implemented. I never cease to be amazed by the genius who was Michael Crighton.
I hadn't read anything in a long while. I picked up my Kindle and saw I had downloaded the preliminary pages of Disclosure which allows me to see if an interest is there. I re-read the pages and was immediately captivated. I bought the book, proceeded to read it, skipped dinner, and didn't put it down until The End. Michael Crichton is an amazing and gifted writer; when time allows, which is sparse, he is my go to author after having lost Robert Ludlum. This is a well written novel about a subject fraught with controversy, emotion, and blame, which usually falls in the laps of men. Crichton takes Sexual Harassment to another very compelling level...one in which the reader is stripped of blinders and given a new pair of glasses. Excellent, Michael Crichton!
I loved the movie and enjoyed the book. I love how it goes deeper into office politics and all the backstabbing games. The reason for the set up against the main character makes more sense than it did in the movie. The movie implies that Meredith Johnson did what she did because she was a scorned lover. The book takes a slightly different approach. Sure, that was one of the reasons but there was so much more going on and she was not alone in her plight to destroy Tom Sanders.
Now I'm wishing that Paul Attanasio's screenplay had given Dylan Baker the chance to play Phil Blackburn the way the character is portrayed in the novel. It's also entertaining to read the book in 2013 when we've come a long way as far as technology is concerned. I chuckled when the main character, Tom Sanders, had to explain to another character what the internet was and how it worked. Another funny part is when he mentions that the cellular phone is capable of storing up to 200 phone numbers in its memory. The reason why I gave it only 4 stars is simple: there's a lot of technical explanation that goes on for 2-3 pages in a chapter.
I found that a little tiresome but maybe it's because it's now almost 20 years since the book came out and the jargon has become more popular. Even if you are not very tech-savvy, you can understand words such as CD-ROM, RAM, hypertext, wireless, etc. I imagine such technical explanation was helpful in the mid-nineties. But, overall, it's a great book.
This is my second favorite Crichton book after Jurassic Park. It starts off slow (like the first 50 pages) but once it gets going, it GOES. You really end up hating Meredith and rooting for Sanders to prevail.
My one complaint (other than the slow start) is the whole thing with the virtual reality file system in the book, where users walk on a treadmill through halls of files to find stuff they need (as opposed to just opening a file menu and searching like that). I'm pretty sure Crichton felt he had to throw in some cool tech like he usually does, but here it doesn't fit at all and isn't even cool. But I didn't think this detracted much from how entertaining the book was.
I have read several of Michael Crichton's books; they are an unequal lot but "Disclosure" is a good read. I think it is the best of all of Crichton's works that I have read. I have a few more to read, I know that some of them will be clunkers, maybe not so bad as "The Great Train Robbery" but they will have a tough time reaching the level of "Disclosure." 
Certainly Crichton has covered a wide variety of themes in his writing, or maybe I should say plots, some writers have said there are only seven themes in all writing and I tend to agree given their definitions, but whichever, "Disclosure" is more than just conflict between men and women portrayed by sexual drive and its common viewpoint.
It is a power struggle with a happy ending(my terminology) if the protagonist has aroused empathy with the reader who may not be maleand hence predisposed, as related in the novel, to view men as always the predator, women as the victim and role reversal is unbelievable.
I have almost always connected Crichton with science fiction and he brings some into this novel, but he is a surprising visionary in that he has forecast (novel first published in 1993) the aceptance of the internet and its worldwide spread coupled with the outcome of the CD war with other magnetic storage devices (tape for video against DVD's and floppy discs for computer storage).
Since it is the fight for CD usage that is one of the key points in the story and with the female antagonist trying to ruin Tom Sanders over his use of the CD as storage it is a shame that production is the battleground, not fact that one form of storage is inherently better than the other. It is Meredith's knuckling under to Malaysian pressure to increase use of local labor and not use machines that has to be proven, getting away from the science of magnetic devices.
It should not be surprising to find that there is a high load of suspense in trying to find fault, especially since the president of the company is backing the woman. Again, I recommend reading the book to get the full enjoyment of the twists and turns used by Meredith to win top dog position.

Amish is the first author who has made me interested in Indian mythology.I really like the character of SIta portrayed is this book as here she has a much larger role than just being kidnapped by Raavan.The story,narration is really good and there is some light philosophy here and there which I absolute love.
This book was absolutely worth the wait of two years because the idea of multilinear narrative is really good and I can't wait to explore the character of Raavan in the next book.
While the first two books of Meluha series were truly captivating, author seems to have succumbed to commercial instincts. Two editions in this series have not been as enjoyable
Well you do slightly begin to lose interest after the 225th page. The only new chapter in the book after the 200th page which has not been adopted from scion of ikshvaku is the one about vali. Otherwise every thing is the same. Even the preview book of raavan does not build up much curiosity. I am excited about the book on Raavan because first time I will read a book with an insight in Raavans life. Sita is perfect only up till the 215th page. It deteriorates a bit but it is bearable. 
Amish tries some of the usual tricks of weaving too much of contemporary politics and events. They was a wow in Meluha when we read this for the first time but not here. Nothing can beat the need for a story and may be a new bag of tricks
Brilliant book. Excellent insight into Sita's world. Finished the book within 24 hours of super-speed delivery from Amazon.in. Moreover got an exclusive preview of the next book too. Thank you Amazon.in. And more importantly thank you amish for this awe inspiring book.
Did pre-order received today ,but Sita was missing got a preview copy of Ravan , now who kidnapped Sita this time when Ravan is wid me
This book is really worth to be a bestseller......... The story is really fascinating......... Author Amish has not let down our expectations...... But little bit disappointed as I did not get any bookmark from Amazon
Worth a read. the narrative keeps you engrossed right uptill the climax, and also keeps you hooked on to the series.
I have received a wrong book. I have not received SITA - Warrior of Mithila.
Not so good..... The book is moving in a slow pace not as exciting as the shiva trioligy.
Lets wait for the book from Raavans point of view
Only thing g required is to stop attaching present situations too much.. otherwise a great stuff .
Your agent canceled my pre order and now offering 50rs compensation... And advising to order again.. Thank you
good price and excellent delivery.
Absolutely stunning piece of writing by Amish. Fast paced book that you will surely enjoy. A different image of Sita for which we were waiting for!
I got my book before time..it was really very nice..for the first time amazon made me happy.
This book gives a good look at Sita's life right from being an orphan child to her rise to status of a goddess. Language is nice and easy. Characterization is good.
the package was torn but the book and the Raavan's prologue or peek in was in shape. Already excited to commence reading it.
Awesome waiting for the next book in line.
Amish has changed the way our mythology has been spun since ages
Thoroughly enjoyed reading this. Have been waiting for the release, and it's worth waiting for. Now eager to read the next volume from the series.
Awesome is the word to describe Amish' writing style. Blending mythology and fiction and making it app at real as if you have lived it. Fantastic.
Excellent and strong portrayal of lady Sita's point of view. Can't wait for the next book to be released. Totally immersive!
there is a story with twists n turns weaved with our history. it also builds charachters n importantly with hows and whys
Very good creativity by Amish, a lot of political wisdom thrown into the book. Awesome. Amish has yet again proved his mantle.
Awesome book, with shocking surprises and fascinating story.
It's one of the best books written by one of the best Indian authors
Got only the complimentary book.
Great work by Amish Exciting book Got it today. Also received a bookmark . Thanks Amazon
Better than scion of ikshvaku, but still not that good
Excellence writing once again by Amish, Sitamata ki jai Jai Shri Ram
I hate u Amazon..... Y only 5 stars...... It should have 10 stars.... Completely amazing book.
amazon.in surprised me with the preview of third book in the series!!too excited!!
Supplement of raavan was a surprise. Thanks
Awesome book with great twists and gripping style. Worth my reading time.
No words for this awesome author. Book was really great.
Fast Delivery and Awesome product quality !!!
Lengthy paragraphs...but good work.
Pre-ordered the book and got it today. It doesn't matter though, but would be much appreciated if got on the same date as released. Super excited to get this book and the preview of 3rd book of the series. Packaging is good. One small disappointment was that it doesn't have "Bookmark". That's why 1 star less rating.
Fast paced, breath taking and nail biting till the last page...
Amish has the knack of leaving you speechless and craving for more... Can't wait for the next installment... This one was definitely better than its prequel... He's raised expectations for his next!
I always thought that nothing could be better than Shiva Trilogy, but I was wrong. Mr. Tripathi has let us explore that world, in more depth, which he introduced us in Shiva Trilogy. Sita - The Warrior Of Mithila has become a source of power for me. Trust me, you can't afford to miss this one. love, Laughter and Peace
Scion of ikshvaku hit a major chord with me, a chord that stood apart from those hit by the shiva trilogy. Because the philosophy had a softer, more polished and a broader tone to it as opposed to the shaper and radical ones offered in the shiva trilogy. It was the injection of that serene mood more than the fantasized storyline that made it heartwarming. So naturally I had expected more of the same and much more from the second book of the series. 
All the broad philosophical themes are still there, the epic vision and imagination still exists but they don't work in harmony. They seem like individual set pieces that don't quite fill up the final storyboard, thus the attempted emotional mileage fell short most of the times and there are supposedly times when Amish dives more into the details, which is fine but you can't help but feel like he is pondering over these details to keep the pieces stitched together, in more straightforward terms, it felt draggy, especially the latter half of the book. 
But I'm still going to pick up the third book with almost the same enthusiasm, as I like the idea of providing a backdoor to all the three main characters before assembling the final showdown, and I'm genuinely interested in how Amish will be handling the extremely strong and enigmatic character of ravana in the next book, and i think he has thrown in a major clue right at the end with regards to what will be coming between raavana and sita.
Well I like the first book of the Ram Chandra Series and waited a frickin more than 1 and a half year for the second part. So as soon as I saw that prr booking offer I just placed it. And boy I loved this book ( not as much as the first book). But now today on 2nd of June I saw that PayTm is selling the same book at way cheaper price, I'm confused whether it was good choice pre ordering a book or should have waited for few days and bought it from PayTm. Thoughts anyone?
I have picked up this book after reading the first book in the Ramachandra series. However I should say this book has not lived up to the benchmark set by the previous book. I love Amish's story telling technique and the way he builds the characters. When I read "Scion of Ikshvaku", I fell in love with Lakshman, Ram, Sita, Jatayu and others. When I read "Sita - Warrior of Mithila", I fell in love with Sunaina and fell for Jatayu again.
I loved Sita's character the warrior, the princess and for the most part, however sometimes the author tried to oversimplify her character much to my dislike. I read and reread the parts where she was a feisty princess, I loved her. Nonetheless the parts where she espouses her views about caste system,dharma, patriotism, I somehow felt that she lacked conviction and they sounded too cliched.This is where I felt disappointed with Sita's characterization.
If you have read "Scion of Ikshvaku", you can read half of the book and then gently ignore the remaining chapters and move on to the last one. Amish should have written this book in 180-200 pages at the most, there is lot of repetition from the first part, not just scenes but chapters together. He should have avoided this and made this book more gripping.
When I want to read a historical fiction, I would want the contemporary influence to be as minimal as possible, if at all there is any it should be really subtle.
The story of a woman whose name is taken as the ideal role model for all women in India. The book has indeed done justice to the character of Sita. I loved seeing Sita as the one who takes charge, crafts her own destiny (and those who she loves!), strategises and executes each of her plans. A must read just for those who want to admire the completeness of her character.
For those who regularly read Amish, Sita has a lot to reveal about his world creation. In fact, I started seeing his previous series, the Shiva Trilogy in a new light. Shall write a longer review soon. But I am yet to see a book that brings the whole splendour of the phenomenon called India in front of our eyes like Sita does. If you are a woman, it is a must read. If you are a patriot (not a jingoist), it is a must read. If you are a lover of creativity, it is a must read.
Note to others: You need not have read Scion of Ikshvaku to read Sita (though I loved the previous part too). So if you are planning to just read this one, you can start from here.
I got the book for free luckily under Kindle promotions. Thanks Amazon and thanks Amish, for an enjoyable read.
Considering everyone knows the basic storyline of Ramayana, the book still has interesting philosophies in it.
It has answers for why Somras was distributed freely among sooryavnshi.
Also why a masculine rule was a good solution for today but and evil for tomorrow.
No party of society can be ignored. Army, business , the poor , the rich all are a part of society and if anyone one is ignored the society will fall.
He has hinted that Ravana is not pure evil, he has good in him.
How the two most important and intelligent clans can be right and wrong at the same time.
How the reverred and worshipped have supported bad to become a hero someday. ? Greed to prove their intelligence ?
I was also wondering how will Amish introduce the process of "churning" Somras. Agatsyakootam and the river was brilliant(if i am correct).
It also has drawn parallels in which Vishnu comes to take care of a society that had tilted it's balance towards feminism and Rudra comes to take care of a society that had tilted balance towards masculinity.
Book is more about philosophies than detailed warfare and unknown plots.
Shiva trilogy was a new story so it had its suspense. Ramachandra Series is a well known story, so it has its difficulties in creating suspense.
I must say "The read was much more than its worth"
Finally thirst is being quenched..!!!
Amazing book!!! But only one thing, in the past whenever i ordered some book i used to get a bookmark with every book but with the last 21 books I haven't got any..!!! Opening the package and looking at that cute bookmark was one joy thing..!! I think and hope with next book i'll get it!!!
And just for a moment, as soon as I opened the cover, I thought I stuck gold where due to a mistake by a Amazon I received the book 3 Raavana. But that didn't last long as it was just a promotional addition.
Nevertheless a good read. Looking forward to next.
Anybody who is planning to start this book should know that this isn't starting from the point 'The Scion of Ikshvaku' left off. This is the story of Sita from her birth till the point where Raavan kidnaps her.
That being said, this is another of the typical Amish books; the story is engaging, the characters are the usual mixed bunch (some pretty strong while the others forgettable) and the language is pretty straightforward. Go ahead if you like reading the novels of Amish and liked the first Ram Chandra novel.
P.S: The next book will also be similar to this, told from the perspective of Raavan, who, if the clues are to be believed, is different from the stereotype evil tyrant (one can always hope).
I have not received any type of phone call for the expected delivery of the novel- Sits the warrior of mithila even though I received the message of its delivery date. And it is quite frustrating when it happens two times in a row. Hope you will take some necessary actions.
Undoubtedly a great write by Amish, continuing what he left off with the Shiva series this book promises to be a bestseller already.
One thing that was super disappointing was "NO BOOKMARK". The only reason for the reduction of the rating!
This is Aryan I forget to eat food today ....indulged in divine journey of seeta....amazing... And after a long wait ...its worth reading
Completed reading the book. The perspective of Ramayana from Sita's point of view till her capture is really interesting but the narrative lagged the excitement of the previous books. Nevertheless, it has it's moments and the Baahubali like climax is interesting.
I ordered 2 books of Sita and instead I received 2 books of Ravan which is a complementary book and not the actual product.
Got today, completed.two chapters...amazing wish to continue until finish. The way connected with part 1 amazing. Oh the preface of Ravana really creating a buzz.
didn't start yet but one thing amish books are amazing for that I'm sure really loved the packing from Amazon and the Ravaan first cover was like Superb eagerly waiting for that and the final book
The story is riveting and takes pace from where it stood in the first part. The highlight of the book is how Amish has the skill of tweaking Ramayana to his brilliant convenience keeping the base storyline same. The turns and surprises can be best enjoyed after reading The Scion of Ikshvaku and then picking up The warrior of Mithila. Needless to say, Sita is gloriously portrayed as never before.
The book is just amazing. I completed it in one day. The part 3 coming in 2018, i am e agerly waiting for it. Waiting for 2 years was worthwhile
Another epic story by Amish. Received the book today. awesome cover and highly amazed about the preview copy of Raavan : The son of aryavarta. I've read all previous book from Amish and hope this keep the excitement retained after Scion of ikshavaku....finger crossed and hop RSOA is launched soon!!
The book describes sita's perspective in a very good manner. Though i felt some parts were similar to the first book of Ram Chandra series. Overall the essence was well captured and overall it intrigues you to know what happens later.
First of all i am a big fan of amish sir and i had read all the books he had written. I have received my order today and i am excited to read it. I know that this book is also going to be blockbuster.
The book was ok..after 200 pages story loses momentum...still looking forward to the next book on Ravana
Loved it.. really proud of being INDIAN..our history rocks.. hats off to Amish for such a wonderful book..keep it up..looking forward for more such gems..
Amazing. Just start reading and get on the beautiful thrilling journey- Sita
Instead of Sits , I was given Raavan the third book of Ram Chandra series
Interesting world created by the author good work of fiction. Will be interesting to see how the author handles shambhok
Amazing story telling from a different point of view. What if it actually was true? As always hungry for Ravaan
Even though it is not a sequel of the frist book ,it is very good. Hoping the next book will not take 2 years
Rereading the first book before an enthusiastic eager to start the second.
delivered on my birthday so happy..
The RamChandra series is a prequel to Shiv trilogy so the reader already has an big idea of the revelations and ending of the series. To make matter even more Worse the current book starts of before Book1, overlaps all events to give the second protagonist point of view. May be to few this does not sound as bad as it is because they may argue that reading a story from a second point of view is also riveting.
All in theory only !!! In practical terms it was reading a story where you knew the start the end and the middle. And because Amish has already told you that he is writing the third book telling the same story again for the third time, so you even knew where the cliff hanger would be !!!
My recommendation and predictions is skip the current book and the next one too. Read the series from book 4 and come back to 2nd and 3rd after the completion of the series if still interested
Got the book today(29.5.17). The cover page is awesome! But I'm always disappointed with the inner page quality and also haven't got any good page marker(metal) like before when I pre-ordered another series of Amish. Anyway,I'm a big fan of what Amish Sir delivers through his writtings...I hope this one will also give satisfaction. And I liked the surprise! Advertisement of book 3!
'Many people are not wise enough to count life's blessings. They keep focusing instead on what the world has denied them.'-Janak, when they found Sita.
Got my copy yesterday along with the preview of Raavan-Orphan of Aryavarta....before the date of delivery.....that's why i love amazon!!! Awesome cover design!!!
Completed three chapters, so good so far!!! And the little Sita in the second chapter looking so cuteðŸ˜˜ðŸ˜˜ 'sleeping like angel'
Attention!!!! Sita is Vishu.....and the demons know about that.
Hehe...one more thing....Hanu bhaiya is also here.
Waiting for Ram to come in to the scene, Curious!!!!
Looking forward to complete the book...i will love it as always loved Amish's writing.
Amish is really sorry for the delay, yes!!! Look in to the book.
But that's okay.....worth waiting.
And please don't make us wait more than one year for your books. All the best!!!!
Sita the warrior princes continues to project the lacunae in Amish's craft... The failure to create a different world and drawing continuing parallels with current India irritates.. Ofcourse its a fast read of the quintessential Amish genre and the story is definitely interesting... Alas... the devil in the details disappoints agai
Got it today. Hope it is as good as the first. :D Looking forward to read it.
Got a pre ordered copy today ans just completed the 1st chapter of this epic mythology saga. save my words this is book which written logically and u can't distracted while reading this. kudos to amish for bringing another mythological saga in terms of ramayana. hats off to you amish. and Amazon as well as for best service.
Rating it without reading. I know it's a masterpiece. Got my copy today.And already in love with the cover.
Amish Tripathi is indeed the best writer in India in the recent time.
After Naga series,Ram Chandra series too has proved the aforesaid.
Sita: warrior of Mithila was good, but as someone rightly pointed out Samichi wasn't as intresting as Vashishta's in the first. also the kindle version doesn't have a sneak peek which i found a bit unfair. Other nthen that no complaints. Worth the wait
Amazing writing as usual my Amish Tripathi. I have been a fan of Amish's since Immortals of Meluha came out. The day i ordered this book, i binge read all the four books before. In LOVE with his books. Please release Raavan - Orphan of Aryavarta soon.
Thanks AmazonIN for such a quick delivery!
Wonderful narration, true feminism. Sita is not weak but she sometimes adjust to circumstances. As per her school name bhoomi, my guess is that she is the one who founded panchavati in Amish Shiva trilogy, bhumi Devi of naga's. It could be Amish way of traditional ramayana in which Rama and sita stay away once sita is pregnant and for good

Runs with the Speed of FGFA !!! After the long wait of 2 years, finally yesterday, "Sita - Warrior Of Mithila " was delivered to me ( at 1556 hours ) and I started the book in the late evening and wrapped it in a single sitting. Like the spell bounded the first installment of the Ram Chandra Series, Sita-Warrior of Mithila "reads with the speed tantamount to any fifth-generation fighter jet. The depiction of a woman warrior justifies the title of the book.
Plot launched with Sita's fighting spirit while her abduction but after the initial chapter, the story went back to the making of the Sita as the warrior princess. And before I write further, let me get one thing clear: Ram Chandra Series is delineated on the epic Ramayana and major anecdotes are taken from it but Amish, as we expect, have weaved a world of fantasy on the basis of that outline.
Subsequent floods had changed the course of river Gandaki, which earlier flows from Mithila, and the rains also failed which caused huge economic damage to Mithila. But Mithila's loss was Sankashya's gain. Mithila was ruled by a devout and spiritual man named Janak who's married to a pragmatic woman Sunaina while the kingdom of Sankashya was ruled by Janak's younger brother Kushadhwaj. But the woes like rainfall-failure makes the Kushadhwaj rose in stature as the de facto representative of the clan of Mithi. 
After seeking the blessings of Kanyakumari , Child Goddess, Janak and Sunaina came across a quaint scene. An injured vulture was surrounded by the pack of wolves and watching this unfair act of aggression, Sunaina spurred her horse to protect the bird and from some distance that the vulture was protecting a baby from the pack of the wolves.Goading her horses into a fierce gallop, Sunaina pressed forward to protect the child and the vulture. Sunaina's arrival scared the wolves to run away and with an approval from Janak, that abandoned child was named as Sita Ã§ause she was found in a furrow in Mother Earth and raised as the princess of Mithila. 
Unlike other princesses, Sita was made to study not just science and philosophy but also learned the martial arts and warfare combat. Later Sita was nurtured as the person who will play a crucial role in making India as the brightest nation again. And in her quest to complete her mission, she chose Ram as her partner. Sita ruled with pragmatism while Ram sticked to the laws. In sita, Ram found an "Ardhangini ", a life-partner who wishes to bring the glory to India.
As wrote above, Amish has re-introduced Sita but with highlighting evils that are dwelling in our society against the woman. For instance the following conversation between Sunaina and Janak, "Sunaina looked at her husband and smiled as she caressed the baby's head. 'How can anyone abandon a child like her ?' Janak Sighed. 
'Many People are not wise enough to count life's blessing. They keep focusing instead on what the world has denied them '", depicts the unfortunate truth of Indian societies in which Girl child are abandoned. Although many women have achieved what men failed to but in some societies girl child is still considered as an ill omen and Amish has rightly depicted how a girl child is a blessing.Apart from raising the tacit issue that Woman should be treated equally, Amish has bolted anecdotes that remind the citizens of their individual duties towards the Nation. 
In our urban society, there is a very common myth that poor are usually bad and avaricious people but Amish has bolted some logical words that will make readers understand that why and how, many times, a poor man is forced to be indulged in crime. "The Criminals among the rich are mostly driven by greed. 
One can negotiate with greed. But the criminals among the poor are driven by desperation and anger. Desperation can sometimes bring out the best in a human being. That's why the poor can often be noble. But desperation can also bring out the worst. 
They have nothing to lose.......But we should not be blind and assume that all poor are noble. Not everyone has the spirit to keep their character strong when their stomachs are angry. " said Sunaina while giving governing lessons to her daughter, Sita. 
Bitter relation of Vashishta & Vishwamitra, as well, keep the plot completely gripping part from the philosophical talks that are mentioned above.
Well,the book is no doubt tempting but the point is Amish takes a hell lotta time to write between books.Please keep us waiting for not more than a year.
My sister bought it for me. Got it on Monday. Looking forward to read it. I was expecting cool bookmark with book art but didn't get one.
The best book, but Why there is no preview chapter of 3rd book Raavana of Rama Series in kindle version of eBook?
It's a great book worth reading waiting for Raavan .... Can't wait more
Had to wait for almost 2 years for this one... Though not exactly a sequel... It presents Sita in a different light altogether... Kind of reminded of Sati from Oath of Vayuputras... Beautiful narration... Great storyline from a new perspective... And kudos to Amazon for prompt delivery in perfect condition... The book 3 preview could have been longer though (given the amount of Amazon exclusive ads for it... Was somewhere deep down slightly disappointed) ... Can't wait for the whole book to be out
i just got it last night and already half way but was dissapointed as this was not authographed by Amish as the last one.... was hoping to preorder will be more collectible of a kind
The cover page itself is so much tempting. Amish has never disappointed me, looking forward to finish this book soon. And the preview booklet provided with this book looks cool too. This book Worth's waiting for two years. And thanks to Amazon too for delivering this in the morning.
Had pre-ordered the book. Got it today. Too excited to start this new journey of Amish's imagination! The cover of the sneak preview book of the third book, "Raavan" looks amaziiiiinng! 
Will update the review as I read the book but I don't think that the stars will come down from 5!
amazing book just recieved it today morning and completed reading also the part 3 preview is amazing.the only thing I hate amish is as he always keep a me waiting .thnx my favourite author.awaiting it next 2 masterpieces.
got this book yesterday[28.05.17]. Rating 5 stars without reading coz i know it wont dissappoint. Even the book cover is so tempting
How can I book 3 which is not even published instead of book 2 which is only published yesterday.
It gave 5 shocks in the first chapter itself Shock 1: Sita is a Vishnu (The is also a clue about this in the last paragraph of Scion of Ikshvaku) Shock 2: Sita knows she is a Vishnu Shock 3: Jatayu was previously a Lankan and was loyal to Raavan (This clue is also mentioned in the last chapter of Scion of Ikshvaku) Shock 4: The Lankans also know that Sita is a Vishnu Shock 5: The Lankans knew Sita since her childhood and she also had a memory of the Lankan captain Khar from her distant past
Plus there is a great shock which is going to be revealed in Raavan --- Orphan of Aryavarta and that is SITA IS THE BIOLOGICAL DAUGHTER OF RAAVAN!!!
The book was excellent in the first half but as it intersected with the 1st books , the anticipation and the suspense died for certain parts. The writing style is certainly much better than any of the previous ones and the time that took to write the book was certainly worth it.
However, grammar was the only weak part of the book. There were no grammatical errors this time around but the sentence formation was somewhat not upto the mark in certain sections.
This is book is the fiction story of the author, who does not know have the basic knowledge of Ramayan, his book is far from reality & he is misguiding about the role of Mother Sita. Extremely disappointed
I already give it a 5 star
If I order the book now...will I get the preview of the Raavan with this.....because have not pre ordered it...
worst
The book tries to explain the enigma that is Sivagami. The narrative is impressive as well as gripping. Still one would have expected to have a few more answers like the story behind Bijjala's paralised arm and how he marries Sivagami. The book seems to confuse matters even further as Sivagami is now Mahadeva's love interest. How many more titles before we get all the answers?
its all worth it. best book i have read so far perfect and precise visual effects described through words My speed of reading has increased due to high level of curiosity per chapter. i totally suggest this book for purchase ! 
This is a very excellent novel with its exhilarating turn of events. The writer gets into each and every minute details of the characters and events so as to give a feeling that we are also a part of this journey. A well planned well said story :)
Just came back from mahishmathi kingdom Waiting to enter again in next part
This is only first part of revenge by shivgami. Story telling is good but there are lot of dark things mentioned, which are many time unnecessary I felt. Due to which this book should not be given to children. Otherwise good enough! 
If your are bahubali lover don't miss this fiction.It depicts the story of Sivagami and Kattappa before the beginning...The way author written the story is outstanding...It really make u sit and read....
Awesome Immersive Narration!! Every Scene of mahishmati and Actions mentioned in book seems floating in mind yet and would love to dive again in same world of words in 2nd Part. Only eliminating certain parts (which are to make novel crispier), the book really sets a platform for Bahubali 3. 
The imagination the story brings is multifold compared to what is shown in both the Bahubali movies. It is a must read for all Bahubali fans across the globe. Totally up for grabs. 
The book will be a nice collection for a book lover with the addition of the other two issues .The story is really nice and there was not a single page where I felt bored and I did not know when I came to the last part of the book and I am really eager what is in store in the next issues. It contains adult related writing so it is not for children.
Each chapter made me spellbound...Just can't wait for the next book...Curious to know more about the mahishmati secrets...Thank you..Will wait..
Great story waiting for second part
