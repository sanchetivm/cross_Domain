Easy to use, easy to clean. Two major requirements for a kitchen appliance for me to be happy. This thing is easier to clean than my old George Foreman Grill (and that to me was a pain in the neck). The only time it can be a little messy is when you change the oil, which I do every 2 to 3 weeks depending on how much I've used it and what I've cooked. If I am doing just veggies, I keep the oil. If I do a meat or seafood, I'll change the oil right after.
I am not say something this product because today I had received a damage product
Product is good but battery not received.
The blades are only 2 in every jar it's grinding work is less and The power of the Pigeon Torrent Mixer Grinder is specified 750W rating. But the actual motor fitted inside this mixer is very small and low power rated. It is not worth buying at Rs.1695/- cost. Item name is misleading the buyer.
needed a mixer grinder for our new home and gave it a try..havent used much but the built quality seems ok..got few batteries as freebies..
Good product They are given delivery on promised time.. Product quality is good
Good Mixer grinder but 2 Jars is broken I am return this product.
Very useful
I have a number of booklites, different vendors, different styles, some AC adapter, some straight battery, cheap to higher prices, and this one is the best, the brightest, the one I will most often use.  It is connected to adapter and kept near computerat all times.  I am careful with such items, don't expect any problems, most booklites are not meant to be manhandled.
My mom is very happy so I can say this..this product is awesome :) thanks amazon
One good thing about this is the powerful motor. However the quality of the jar caps is not that great. You may have to replace after the constant use. Overall its a good product.
It gives burning smell when operating..
Something is not working how is it service

Best in this buget ...Quality of the steel jar is poor.blade are very sharp .Motor is very powerful....
i absolutely love this product. my neighbor has four little yippers and my shepard/chow mix was antogonized by the yipping on our side of the fence. I hung the device on my side of the fence and the noise keeps the neighbors dog from picking "arguments" with my dog. all barking and fighting has ceased. all the surrounding neighbor as well as me can get a good nights sleep now.
We have a six month old pit/lab/heeler mix. The first time he barked after this was turned on, he noticed "something" ... but this hasn't kept him from barking at ALL. I was really hoping it would.
Lookin very good,tough and nice not only main unit but also all jars. In my product The unit not work propperlly....heating another issue....

It's so much heating .....Please stay alert All new customers who wants to buy​ this product
noisy and jars leaking
I need the container with maroon lid...two times when we ordered it came with red lid...so can I get maroon lid
Great Product bought at great price. I was looking to buy this product since long but was looking for a good price. Was able to grab the deal for Rs 6709 and additional 5% from HDFC depit card was the cherry on the cake. Also got a set of microwave containers with the unit. Packing was good and delivery was spot on. Thanks Amazon...Overall great experience
Good one but i got red color..expected purple.. Duplicate of Tupperware! Very bad quality it was broken from inside when i recieved it.. We cannot ordered above 100 CD or DVD.
I personally used this product and my suggestion is don't run it long time, less than 1 minute is enough and cool the machine for 5 minutes then you can run next, 4 times if you can do like this your machine will be run for long time and your dry grinding items will be powder.Don't the machine over load, half portion of container material is ok.
Product is good but battery not received.
The product is having a crack on its body. I need another piece immediately
good for only small family
Quality wise the product is ok at this price but the only thing is that Amazon failed to keep it's word of providing the batteries (offer) that's why one star less.......
Awesome product... I recommend it..
Hi , the product is covered under 2 years of warranty. you can call this number - 18001024041 , and a technician will visit and find a solution, the company can even change the product if the problem persists. Has happened with me. therefore sharing my experience with you.
Didn't Get Started After Power Up And Very Cheap Product, Body, Jars, Blades, Even Power Cable is Cheaper.
Excellent product on this price.
Good product at low cost
I have not received 10 pcs Battery with the pack.
Very good item,it word well.Also the price is very very economical and powerful as this is 750 W mixie.Worth purchasing and supplied as per the specifications.
Very bad it run only one time after that I am struggling.
Mixer dete hai lekin free wali battery nikal ke fasate hai
I am not received 10 pcs Battery with the pack.
Just grt, got in lightening deal wid 10 free batteries. !Only miss the handles of the jars else its silent than a bajaj s harsh motor.
It's good. But it doesn't grind everything so easily. You have to run the motor for a bit longer duration,say 1 minute more than your usual machine. But I think the money you give us worth the quality. It's not as expensive.

Very nice product in this price.
The steel jar cracked in 8 days of use. The steel is of very low quality. Never expected from a brand like preethi and Amazon.
Battery not available only small jar is grinding. Big jar is not grinding. Asked for replacement.
Good Mixer grinder but 2 Jars is broken I am return this product.
Sometimes it sprays when she barks, most of the time it doesn't. So I would say its effectiveness has been rather low. It's not the battery or the fill level - maybe it just depends on the dog. I can bark into it myself and it sprays just fine. (My children found this amusing.

I was so excited to get this product and end my dog's barking. It worked a bit for the first few days or so, I think mostly because my dog was startled by it. But, as time went on, he got used to it and now it doesn't make any difference at all.
Simply Says...it's good....
It also doesn't work 100% of the time...and we're not sure why.  When we fill it, it seems to work fairly well right after but it either does not have as many sprays as it is supposed to, or it isn't working very long.
It's so much heating .....Please stay alert All new customers who wants to buy​ this product
This device does not work as it is supposed to. I've tried different batteries (brand new) and it doesn't seem to matter. The device has to be about three feet away from my dog for it to kick on and it doesn't work consistently so it is not effective for training a dog.
It's good. But it doesn't grind everything so easily. You have to run the motor for a bit longer duration,say 1 minute more than your usual machine. But I think the money you give us worth the quality. It's not as expensive.
Quite good. Noise is same as other Mixer Grinder. Could register online for warranty.

I was really looking forward to receive this product. My dog is a small one - 12 pounds - 3 years old. Her only flaw is that when someone rings the intercom she goes crazy barking. I purchased this item because I researched it - I expected it to work. It didn't - it does light when she barks, I even point it at her and press the button, she stops for one second then back to the same old, even if I continually point and press it.

The product quality is worst very low quality materials are used. Very bad. Not satisfied with the product
product is good but it is not working more time, i use it. It is heat when we use 3-4 time a day & the courier takes more time for delivery
Serves the purpose absolutely. You may feel the build quality is a bit poor, but that doesn't affect the performance, which is quite good. If you're not too keen on aesthetics of the appliance, you can blindly go for this one. I have so far used it for making shakes, chutney, grinding spices n blending, mincing meat and wasn't disappointed at all.
One good thing about this is the powerful motor. However the quality of the jar caps is not that great. You may have to replace after the constant use. Overall its a good product.
Pros- Good quality materials High rpm(21000) 5 year warranty on motor Lifetime free service (as mentioned on the leaflet) Cons- Jars make noise Wire is small as compared to the over old mixer There is no Authorised service centre in rajasthan
Good one but i got red color..expected purple.. Duplicate of Tupperware! Very bad quality it was broken from inside when i recieved it.. We cannot ordered above 100 CD or DVD.
Works as it should. Product is lighter than expected!
This product is ok but it will get hot sooner..
My mom is very happy so I can say this..this product is awesome :) thanks amazon
Good product no damages nice packing... Low price good quality...
I bought this because a friend swears by the outdoor one made by same company. But it doesn't seem to be helping with my small indoor dogs.
Very good item,it word well.Also the price is very very economical and powerful as this is 750 W mixie.Worth purchasing and supplied as per the specifications.

Having read the other reviews of this product on this site, I decided to go ahead and give these collars a shot despite some of the problems other reviewers had encountered.  I ordered three of these products from this site, and when they arrived, not a single one of them worked - at all.  They were completely useless and despite trying everything other reviewers and the manufacturer suggested, these products are completely useless.  Although I have contacted the manufacturer of this product about the defects, I would still like the buyer to be aware that if purchasing this product from this website, that if the product does not work, it can not be returned for a refund or even exchanged.  Thus, your credit card will still be billed, your dogs will still be barking, and you may get stuck with products that are worthless.
Quality wise the product is ok at this price but the only thing is that Amazon failed to keep it's word of providing the batteries (offer) that's why one star less.......
Initially, my dogs found the sound interesting and slowed down on barking, but after a couple of days they acted like they didn't even hear the sound. Now, they are back to "bark all you want".
Conclusion..this is strictly my opinion..Its very hard to find a CDMA mobile, mmx cg666 do not disappoint u
worst product i got amazon. defective not working product given me.
Didn't Get Started After Power Up And Very Cheap Product, Body, Jars, Blades, Even Power Cable is Cheaper.
Nic product at this price tag.. #i hve got it in 6 dayzz of order #working fine... #value of money.. #it is light weight#which izz quite suprising. #wt a 1 year warranty..
My mom is very happy so I can say this..this product is awesome :) thanks amazon
I've always wanted a deep fryer, and finally decided to take the plunge.  After doing quite a bit of research, I decided on this model - picked one up at Bed, Bath, and Beyond with a 20% coupon.  In my opinion, you generally get what you pay for - so the extra cost vs. competitors wasn't a real concern.
I am not received 10 pcs Battery with the pack.
product is okay.....but finishing not good. black gum patches everywhere in jars....okay at this price
Product is made of low quality material and the product received was broken... It's not worth to buy at all
good, no noise motor, and the grinder is excellent
Bought it, set it up, my dogs bark just as bad, doesn't faze them at all. Waste of money, don't buy
Nice at price of 1300 rs
i think these products are refurbished. never had such an experience with amazon.First order the jar teeth was broken. ordered a replacement....it had scratches on the main unit and lid of one of the jars was cracked...disappointed...
The blades of mixer are not sharp I am very disappointed with the product The free batteries did not come with grinder
It's so much heating .....Please stay alert All new customers who wants to buy​ this product
Excellent works fine Only problem is Lid comes off on need a lock...
I have purchased it around 1300 and it's been 2 months after using it Iam writing this review. I think this is the Best Buy I got at the price, it is working excellent till now. This mixer is quite better compared to other high range products.
Very nice product vry slowly voice it's amazing..
The steel jar cracked in 8 days of use. The steel is of very low quality. Never expected from a brand like preethi and Amazon.
Mixer dete hai lekin free wali battery nikal ke fasate hai
Excellent Working I saw many mixer grinder but during grinding some pastes and rice items with grinder i did not feel any vibrates smoothly works packing was good as always Thank You Amazon For A amazing Deal
This item is cheaply made and I sent it back.  The picture looks cool but it's deceiving.  The minute hand was so loose that when it was on the right side, it flopped down to the right and then when it was on the left, it plopped down to the left.  It couldn't keep the right time.
Was broken and for return they charge money as courier charge
The item is very compact and space saver as well as useful for all the occasions.
quality of steel is decent. But the size of two small jars is too less than normal size jar sizes should have been made this a perfect mixer set
Very good product working fine speed is high noise is OK good looking, container metal is good, but there is some problem of container locking vartical line of container locker should clear by company for this it is not locking properly, user can do it but it will do carefully otherwise it can be broken.
Good Mixer grinder but 2 Jars is broken I am return this product.

Product build looks cheap like some local brand.
product is nyc it is working properly.
Light weight superb design But delivery very poor
The small jar got damaged on its first try. So don't ever take a chance.
Lid is not getting close properly. Size is too small than what appears in the picture.
product is nyc it is working properly.
Quality of blade is very poor. Blade of one jar broken.
Excellent product on this price.
My mixer grinder us out of order since 12-15 days and yet Pigeon personnel are not getting it rectified. Everyday there is a new excuse for not attending to the issue. Even customer care hasn't kept its promise. Also the mixer went bad within 40 days of purchase. I got cheated.
Very bad performance. It did not work even for two minutes. Poor quality.
It also doesn't work 100% of the time...and we're not sure why.  When we fill it, it seems to work fairly well right after but it either does not have as many sprays as it is supposed to, or it isn't working very long.
Works as it should. Product is lighter than expected!
The seller was so friendly for solving my queries and product was awesome. thanks. Quality good, delivery on time , packing good.

I am a moderate/ Domestic user after using this product for almost a month, Its flawless, Excellent product good motor less sound .. I am a happy user
Product not upto the mark,but compare to price its ok.

Worth of money....good
Had bought it for someone and she loved it.Is useful and good quality.
Ridiculously loud, enough to cause your ears to ache, and doesn't grind efficiently. The screws holding the handles are on the inside of the jar, so you can't use a spatula efficiently, and scrubber fibers keep getting entangled.

i have been using last two week . it is great & working fine but i am in doubt that the grinder blade may be broken if i grinding the spices(KHARA MASALA) .
The product quality is worst very low quality materials are used. Very bad. Not satisfied with the product
Good Product from the company, it seems like they have take a generic product and just paste eveready on it. Very sturdy and useful. However, the Jars does not fit properly in the machine. I modified the locks and now it is fine. You cannot ask more in 1200 bucks. My wife is fine with it, therefore, I am super fine.
It's Very Bad Product.Jar Very small,only one jar With Handle,Other 2 jar's without Handle..

I have Zen m81 using with tata indica, which is a totally argent phone, fail to receive signal and can't speak smoothly..m81 have worst earpiece sounds..so that I changed the model to mmx cg666
its not working properly. Very bad experience
But one thing before grinding of turmeric it must be small pieces otherwise blades can be broken and damage the machine. Finally I will tell, it is a 5 star product in this price range. Only flaw is looking otherwise it's very fine product.

Very worst product. Bought just before 4 days, it stopped working. As it was gift to my sister.. I couldn't face them again because of this product.
Yorkshire had to be standing within 3 feet before ultrasound was effective so dog just moved over a couple of feet to bark.
I was so thrilled when I unpacked my processor.  It is  so high quality and professional in both looks and performance.  It has so many features that I love, especially the triple bowl which allows you to process more than one substance at a time.  The egg beater attachment is excellent also.  I am one happy customer and recommend this processor to all.

RETURNED
Quality of blade is very poor. Blade of one jar broken.
i absolutely love this product. my neighbor has four little yippers and my shepard/chow mix was antogonized by the yipping on our side of the fence. I hung the device on my side of the fence and the noise keeps the neighbors dog from picking "arguments" with my dog. all barking and fighting has ceased. all the surrounding neighbor as well as me can get a good nights sleep now.
Good quality. Blending is fine.
The blades of mixer are not sharp I am very disappointed with the product The free batteries did not come with grinder
The item is very compact and space saver as well as useful for all the occasions.
The power of the Pigeon Torrent Mixer Grinder is specified 750W rating. But the actual motor fitted inside this mixer is very small and low power rated. It is not worth buying at Rs.1695/- cost. Item name is misleading the buyer.
This item is cheaply made and I sent it back.  The picture looks cool but it's deceiving.  The minute hand was so loose that when it was on the right side, it flopped down to the right and then when it was on the left, it plopped down to the left.  It couldn't keep the right time.
Small Jar not fitting properly on mixer, need to put hand and keep it pressed for using it. Mixer makes lots of noice however seems to do its job without any issue. .... Bill as well as warranty card has no mention of purchase date, warranty card not filled and stampted.
Excellent works fine Only problem is Lid comes off on need a lock...
Very very good product, I got it from amazon 29/01/2017 PRICE 1259.00, motor speed very high,fan speed very high, grind very well. This is the best buy for me, THANK YOU AMAZON. I need two another Eveready glowi mixer grinder , when price 1259.00

We have a six month old pit/lab/heeler mix. The first time he barked after this was turned on, he noticed "something" ... but this hasn't kept him from barking at ALL. I was really hoping it would.
It's good working....
Cons: Ring tone volume is low, hard to hear on outside noisy conditions. Call and back buttons are integrated so that difficult to press call button alone. Tried mp3 to select as ringtone from memory card but failed, u cannot send contacts through Bluetooth.

Sometimes it sprays when she barks, most of the time it doesn't. So I would say its effectiveness has been rather low. It's not the battery or the fill level - maybe it just depends on the dog. I can bark into it myself and it sprays just fine. (My children found this amusing.
good for only small family

Initially, my dogs found the sound interesting and slowed down on barking, but after a couple of days they acted like they didn't even hear the sound. Now, they are back to "bark all you want".
Simply Says...it's good....
I've spent ten years and hundreds (and hundreds and hundreds!) of dollars collecting German steel.  Global is so good that it has me thinking of starting all over again.
quality of steel is decent. But the size of two small jars is too less than normal size jar sizes should have been made this a perfect mixer set
Didn't Get Started After Power Up And Very Cheap Product, Body, Jars, Blades, Even Power Cable is Cheaper. RETURNED
Didn't Get Started After Power Up And Very Cheap Product, Body, Jars, Blades, Even Power Cable is Cheaper.
The item was replaced twice. Both times the packaging was flimsy and the free batteries promised by the seller was missing. As a compensation Amazon provided gift card worth the value of the batteries. Mixer has been working well for about a month.
Good item for mixing and grinding So use this 0roduct freeli khanks Vuiigui9 oiho989 o09opp oopijo0 jughu iuu89 gjhgh jhghu
750 watt motor is best but in jars atleast one jar have 4 cutting blades
Very useful
Very good product I got from Amazon...
worst product i got amazon. defective not working product given me.
after few days, it sounds like old car engine!!!
Good one but i got red color..expected purple.. Duplicate of Tupperware! Very bad quality it was broken from inside when i recieved it.. We cannot ordered above 100 CD or DVD.
Very good item,it word well.Also the price is very very economical and powerful as this is 750 W mixie.Worth purchasing and supplied as per the specifications.
Serves the purpose absolutely. You may feel the build quality is a bit poor, but that doesn't affect the performance, which is quite good. If you're not too keen on aesthetics of the appliance, you can blindly go for this one. I have so far used it for making shakes, chutney, grinding spices n blending, mincing meat and wasn't disappointed at all.
Nice product in Low price
I was really looking forward to receive this product. My dog is a small one - 12 pounds - 3 years old. Her only flaw is that when someone rings the intercom she goes crazy barking. I purchased this item because I researched it - I expected it to work. It didn't - it does light when she barks, I even point it at her and press the button, she stops for one second then back to the same old, even if I continually point and press it.
Good quality product. revived product expected delivery. Thanks.
Didn't Get Started After Power Up And Very Cheap Product, Body, Jars, Blades, Even Power Cable is Cheaper.
Very very good product, I got it from amazon 29/01/2017 PRICE 1259.00, motor speed very high,fan speed very high, grind very well. This is the best buy for me, THANK YOU AMAZON. I need two another Eveready glowi mixer grinder , when price 1259.00
Mixer is good, but the small pot lid is very difficult to remove. And the lid shape is so bad that u will end up tearing your hand to remove the lid from pot.
Best in this buget ...Quality of the steel jar is poor.blade are very sharp .Motor is very powerful....
This item is cheaply made and I sent it back.  The picture looks cool but it's deceiving.  The minute hand was so loose that when it was on the right side, it flopped down to the right and then when it was on the left, it plopped down to the left.  It couldn't keep the right time.
Best Product,Best and Fair Price,Made by good quality of plastic and steel material, Heavy motor,Good Packaging. Buy Now. I personally recommended after 6 month of using.
I personally used this product and my suggestion is don't run it long time, less than 1 minute is enough and cool the machine for 5 minutes then you can run next, 4 times if you can do like this your machine will be run for long time and your dry grinding items will be powder.Don't the machine over load, half portion of container material is ok.

I have a number of booklites, different vendors, different styles, some AC adapter, some straight battery, cheap to higher prices, and this one is the best, the brightest, the one I will most often use.  It is connected to adapter and kept near computerat all times.  I am careful with such items, don't expect any problems, most booklites are not meant to be manhandled.
Good Product from the company, it seems like they have take a generic product and just paste eveready on it. Very sturdy and useful. However, the Jars does not fit properly in the machine. I modified the locks and now it is fine. You cannot ask more in 1200 bucks. My wife is fine with it, therefore, I am super fine.
Very good product working fine speed is high noise is OK good looking, container metal is good, but there is some problem of container locking vartical line of container locker should clear by company for this it is not locking properly, user can do it but it will do carefully otherwise it can be broken.
Bought it, set it up, my dogs bark just as bad, doesn't faze them at all. Waste of money, don't buy
Yorkshire had to be standing within 3 feet before ultrasound was effective so dog just moved over a couple of feet to bark.
Very useful
Product build looks cheap like some local brand.
Hi , the product is covered under 2 years of warranty. you can call this number - 18001024041 , and a technician will visit and find a solution, the company can even change the product if the problem persists. Has happened with me. therefore sharing my experience with you.
The item is very compact and space saver as well as useful for all the occasions.
Got it well before the estimated delivery date. Packaging was ok. Got free starter kit and recipe booklet. Waiting for demo and first time cooking experience.
Good Mixer grinder but unfortunately one of pot blades was damaged. So I replaced it .Then brought another brand Mixer Grinder. Also Juicer Jar Is small but can be not issue for many peoples.
Battery not available only small jar is grinding. Big jar is not grinding. Asked for replacement.
we had to return as it is making lot of noise.. our 6 old preethi is still better than this and works well..
Product is good but battery not received.
I have purchased it around 1300 and it's been 2 months after using it Iam writing this review. I think this is the Best Buy I got at the price, it is working excellent till now. This mixer is quite better compared to other high range products.
I've always wanted a deep fryer, and finally decided to take the plunge.  After doing quite a bit of research, I decided on this model - picked one up at Bed, Bath, and Beyond with a 20% coupon.  In my opinion, you generally get what you pay for - so the extra cost vs. competitors wasn't a real concern.
Till now product has worked ok and i hope it works like that in coming days also. Quiet fast and really quiet as compared to Sumeet we had earlier.

Having read the other reviews of this product on this site, I decided to go ahead and give these collars a shot despite some of the problems other reviewers had encountered.  I ordered three of these products from this site, and when they arrived, not a single one of them worked - at all.  They were completely useless and despite trying everything other reviewers and the manufacturer suggested, these products are completely useless.  Although I have contacted the manufacturer of this product about the defects, I would still like the buyer to be aware that if purchasing this product from this website, that if the product does not work, it can not be returned for a refund or even exchanged.  Thus, your credit card will still be billed, your dogs will still be barking, and you may get stuck with products that are worthless.
good for only small family

Just grt, got in lightening deal wid 10 free batteries. !Only miss the handles of the jars else its silent than a bajaj s harsh motor.
Lid is not getting close properly. Size is too small than what appears in the picture.
I have a number of booklites, different vendors, different styles, some AC adapter, some straight battery, cheap to higher prices, and this one is the best, the brightest, the one I will most often use.  It is connected to adapter and kept near computerat all times.  I am careful with such items, don't expect any problems, most booklites are not meant to be manhandled.

This is a very useful Product. Highly Customer Friendly!!! Recommend to buy!!!
Very bad performance. It did not work even for two minutes. Poor quality.
Initially, my dogs found the sound interesting and slowed down on barking, but after a couple of days they acted like they didn't even hear the sound. Now, they are back to "bark all you want".
it came in original packing no other care to support . but it came good condition no breakage. it working smooth with low noise . I suggest to buy.
Cons: Ring tone volume is low, hard to hear on outside noisy conditions. Call and back buttons are integrated so that difficult to press call button alone. Tried mp3 to select as ringtone from memory card but failed, u cannot send contacts through Bluetooth.
i think these products are refurbished. never had such an experience with amazon.First order the jar teeth was broken. ordered a replacement....it had scratches on the main unit and lid of one of the jars was cracked...disappointed...
Excellent product on this price.
Best Product,Best and Fair Price,Made by good quality of plastic and steel material, Heavy motor,Good Packaging. Buy Now. I personally recommended after 6 month of using.
Product is good but battery not received.
I am not say something this product because today I had received a damage product
Its like ever ready .nice and best for house use.
Something is not working how is it service
Very useful
Small jar is slightly broken
No problem so far.It is value for money.
good for only small family
The item is very compact and space saver as well as useful for all the occasions.
I have not received 10 pcs Battery with the pack.
Product build looks cheap like some local brand.
It's good. But it doesn't grind everything so easily. You have to run the motor for a bit longer duration,say 1 minute more than your usual machine. But I think the money you give us worth the quality. It's not as expensive.
I got the mixer with big jar lead broken. Overall quality is average. Will Amazon replace the lid?

One good thing about this is the powerful motor. However the quality of the jar caps is not that great. You may have to replace after the constant use. Overall its a good product.

Excellent Working I saw many mixer grinder but during grinding some pastes and rice items with grinder i did not feel any vibrates smoothly works packing was good as always Thank You Amazon For A amazing Deal
It also doesn't work 100% of the time...and we're not sure why.  When we fill it, it seems to work fairly well right after but it either does not have as many sprays as it is supposed to, or it isn't working very long.
Product build looks cheap like some local brand.
I've spent ten years and hundreds (and hundreds and hundreds!) of dollars collecting German steel.  Global is so good that it has me thinking of starting all over again.
Bought It To Gift My Aunt On Their Marriage Anniversary, But Very 1st Time Amazon And Cloudtail (Biggest Seller On Amazon) Disappoints Me.

I was so excited to get this product and end my dog's barking. It worked a bit for the first few days or so, I think mostly because my dog was startled by it. But, as time went on, he got used to it and now it doesn't make any difference at all.
Very worst product, this container not a air tight, not a genuine product, before buy read return policy , i was spend 70 rs for delivery charge and now i was getting defective product, i want to return this product but again i want to spend 100 rs courier charge total 170 rs waste of money.
I have Zen m81 using with tata indica, which is a totally argent phone, fail to receive signal and can't speak smoothly..m81 have worst earpiece sounds..so that I changed the model to mmx cg666
Light weight superb design But delivery very poor

Simply Says...it's good....
My mixer grinder us out of order since 12-15 days and yet Pigeon personnel are not getting it rectified. Everyday there is a new excuse for not attending to the issue. Even customer care hasn't kept its promise. Also the mixer went bad within 40 days of purchase. I got cheated.
Very bad performance. It did not work even for two minutes. Poor quality.
Concept is good, plastic can be better, lids are fairly air tight, high and colourful. Kurtzy is written across the side which I did not care for much. The packing was good and delivery was really fast. So enjoyment is guarantee. 1900ml can hold 1.2 kg of dal/rice and the 2500ml hold approximately 2.2 kgs.
product is okay.....but finishing not good. black gum patches everywhere in jars....okay at this price
Nic product at this price tag.. #i hve got it in 6 dayzz of order #working fine... #value of money.. #it is light weight#which izz quite suprising. #wt a 1 year warranty..

Excellent works fine Only problem is Lid comes off on need a lock..
The item was replaced twice. Both times the packaging was flimsy and the free batteries promised by the seller was missing. As a compensation Amazon provided gift card worth the value of the batteries. Mixer has been working well for about a month.
Everready cell not received in package....
Bought it, set it up, my dogs bark just as bad, doesn't faze them at all. Waste of money, don't buy
Very good product in this price range and wattage range. Bought six months ago .........working without any problem or complaint.

Easy to use, easy to clean. Two major requirements for a kitchen appliance for me to be happy. This thing is easier to clean than my old George Foreman Grill (and that to me was a pain in the neck). The only time it can be a little messy is when you change the oil, which I do every 2 to 3 weeks depending on how much I've used it and what I've cooked. If I am doing just veggies, I keep the oil. If I do a meat or seafood, I'll change the oil right after.
Very good product in this price range and wattage range. Bought six months ago .........working without any problem or complaint.
pros: Easy to grip on hand, ear piece sound clarity ok, nice look, good battery back up last around 5days, signal reception ok, over all its works smoothly and speedy compare to other phones around this price.
Though the 10 batteries set is free with mixi...all the batteries were removed from package, damaged and not looked like new batteries. Then what is the use of free batteries with the product
Light weight superb design But delivery very poor
very bad. received damaged product
It's so much heating .....Please stay alert All new customers who wants to buy​ this product
No it is not as per expectation. The manufacturer warranty is not there as mentioned so not recommended.
My mom is very happy so I can say this..this product is awesome :) thanks amazon
Till now product has worked ok and i hope it works like that in coming days also. Quiet fast and really quiet as compared to Sumeet we had earlier.

Pros- Good quality materials High rpm(21000) 5 year warranty on motor Lifetime free service (as mentioned on the leaflet) Cons- Jars make noise Wire is small as compared to the over old mixer There is no Authorised service centre in rajasthan
The product is having a crack on its body. I need another piece immediately

Nice product with this price tag with 2 years warranty. but i had returned it. because i am looking for a juicer mixer grinder.
The small jar got damaged on its first try. So don't ever take a chance.
Very very good product, I got it from amazon 29/01/2017 PRICE 1259.00, motor speed very high,fan speed very high, grind very well. This is the best buy for me, THANK YOU AMAZON. I need two another Eveready glowi mixer grinder , when price 1259.00
very bad. received damaged product
It gives burning smell when operating..
good, no noise motor, and the grinder is excellent
Very good product in this price range and wattage range. Bought six months ago .........working without any problem or complaint.
Good Mixer grinder but unfortunately one of pot blades was damaged. So I replaced it .Then brought another brand Mixer Grinder. Also Juicer Jar Is small but can be not issue for many peoples.
It's Very Bad Product.Jar Very small,only one jar With Handle,Other 2 jar's without Handle..

Sometimes it sprays when she barks, most of the time it doesn't. So I would say its effectiveness has been rather low. It's not the battery or the fill level - maybe it just depends on the dog. I can bark into it myself and it sprays just fine. (My children found this amusing.
Good product with in budget price.
we had to return as it is making lot of noise.. our 6 old preethi is still better than this and works well..

Product not upto the mark,but compare to price its ok.
Product is made of low quality material and the product received was broken... It's not worth to buy at all
Five stars Because the product arrived was really nice... Price satisfying product... Worth the money... No defect identified...
The blades of mixer are not sharp I am very disappointed with the product The free batteries did not come with grinder
That is a Verry verry Good items it's worked verry good.

Lookin very good,tough and nice not only main unit but also all jars. In my product The unit not work propperlly....heating another issue....
I purchased 3 units and they work well for us.  I have 2 units in children's bedrooms on AC power and the 3rd in the kitchen on batteries for portability.  The sound is clear and set-up and use is very easy.  The best thing about these units is the VOX answer option.  I have this option turned on in the kid's room and they merely have to answer back when I talk to them first without having to push the "talk" button.  This is very handy when you are talking to a 3 yr. old that doesn't quite understand how to use this.  I attached a large, very thin magnet on the back of my kitchen unit and I keep it on my fridge; but can bring it with me to other parts of the house if necessary.  The only small annoying feature is every time the "talk" button is pressed, a beep occurs.  But the other features outweight that small annoyance for me.
I am not say something this product because today I had received a damage product
It's good working....
Blades of the Containers are not sufficient
its not working properly. Very bad experience
Nice product in Low price
Had bought it for someone and she loved it.Is useful and good quality.
The blades of mixer are not sharp I am very disappointed with the product The free batteries did not come with grinder
The product quality is worst very low quality materials are used. Very bad. Not satisfied with the product
Money value product.
Good product at low cost
Good Mixer grinder but 2 Jars is broken I am return this product.
The product is looking very nice. Working perfectly.jars are not to good only 2 blades are there but is ok.jars have a heavy plastic material's lids. Very nice product. Thank u Amazone...
quality of steel is decent. But the size of two small jars is too less than normal size jar sizes should have been made this a perfect mixer set

Nice product with this price tag with 2 years warranty. but i had returned it. because i am looking for a juicer mixer grinder.
Quality wise the product is ok at this price but the only thing is that Amazon failed to keep it's word of providing the batteries (offer) that's why one star less.......
Mixer dete hai lekin free wali battery nikal ke fasate hai

750 watt motor is best but in jars atleast one jar have 4 cutting blades
I bought this because a friend swears by the outdoor one made by same company. But it doesn't seem to be helping with my small indoor dogs.
Jar fitting issue little bit, otherwise good.

Was broken and for return they charge money as courier charge
Though the 10 batteries set is free with mixi...all the batteries were removed from package, damaged and not looked like new batteries. Then what is the use of free batteries with the product
Ridiculously loud, enough to cause your ears to ache, and doesn't grind efficiently. The screws holding the handles are on the inside of the jar, so you can't use a spatula efficiently, and scrubber fibers keep getting entangled.
This item is cheaply made and I sent it back.  The picture looks cool but it's deceiving.  The minute hand was so loose that when it was on the right side, it flopped down to the right and then when it was on the left, it plopped down to the left.  It couldn't keep the right time.
This product is too much noisey. Cannot tolret 1 min.. going to return this product. I suggest to all user don't buy this product.
Good quality product. revived product expected delivery. Thanks.
I have a number of booklites, different vendors, different styles, some AC adapter, some straight battery, cheap to higher prices, and this one is the best, the brightest, the one I will most often use.  It is connected to adapter and kept near computerat all times.  I am careful with such items, don't expect any problems, most booklites are not meant to be manhandled.
i think these products are refurbished. never had such an experience with amazon.First order the jar teeth was broken. ordered a replacement....it had scratches on the main unit and lid of one of the jars was cracked...disappointed...
Serves the purpose absolutely. You may feel the build quality is a bit poor, but that doesn't affect the performance, which is quite good. If you're not too keen on aesthetics of the appliance, you can blindly go for this one. I have so far used it for making shakes, chutney, grinding spices n blending, mincing meat and wasn't disappointed at all.
The performance of the product was good but the plastic is waste quality the I mixer which I received had a crack on the base. It was urgent for me so I unscrewed the base and feviquick it.

The power of the Pigeon Torrent Mixer Grinder is specified 750W rating. But the actual motor fitted inside this mixer is very small and low power rated. It is not worth buying at Rs.1695/- cost. Item name is misleading the buyer.
This product is ok but it will get hot sooner..
Great Product bought at great price. I was looking to buy this product since long but was looking for a good price. Was able to grab the deal for Rs 6709 and additional 5% from HDFC depit card was the cherry on the cake. Also got a set of microwave containers with the unit. Packing was good and delivery was spot on. Thanks Amazon...Overall great experience
Was broken and for return they charge money as courier charge
I am not received 10 pcs Battery with the pack.
The product quality is worst very low quality materials are used. Very bad. Not satisfied with the product
Very worst product, this container not a air tight, not a genuine product, before buy read return policy , i was spend 70 rs for delivery charge and now i was getting defective product, i want to return this product but again i want to spend 100 rs courier charge total 170 rs waste of money.
Good one but i got red color..expected purple.. Duplicate of Tupperware! Very bad quality it was broken from inside when i recieved it.. We cannot ordered above 100 CD or DVD.
The steel jar cracked in 8 days of use. The steel is of very low quality. Never expected from a brand like preethi and Amazon.
It also doesn't work 100% of the time...and we're not sure why.  When we fill it, it seems to work fairly well right after but it either does not have as many sprays as it is supposed to, or it isn't working very long.
This item is cheaply made and I sent it back.  The picture looks cool but it's deceiving.  The minute hand was so loose that when it was on the right side, it flopped down to the right and then when it was on the left, it plopped down to the left.  It couldn't keep the right time.
Conclusion..this is strictly my opinion..Its very hard to find a CDMA mobile, mmx cg666 do not disappoint u
I've always wanted a deep fryer, and finally decided to take the plunge.  After doing quite a bit of research, I decided on this model - picked one up at Bed, Bath, and Beyond with a 20% coupon.  In my opinion, you generally get what you pay for - so the extra cost vs. competitors wasn't a real concern.
We have a six month old pit/lab/heeler mix. The first time he barked after this was turned on, he noticed "something" ... but this hasn't kept him from barking at ALL. I was really hoping it would.
The steel jar cracked in 8 days of use. The steel is of very low quality. Never expected from a brand like preethi and Amazon.
Speed regulator is not working properly, it's working only at highest speed, other speed functions are not working, I got defective peice
But one thing before grinding of turmeric it must be small pieces otherwise blades can be broken and damage the machine. Finally I will tell, it is a 5 star product in this price range. Only flaw is looking otherwise it's very fine product.
Nice product in Low price
Very nice product in this price.
Very very good product, I got it from amazon 29/01/2017 PRICE 1259.00, motor speed very high,fan speed very high, grind very well. This is the best buy for me, THANK YOU AMAZON. I need two another Eveready glowi mixer grinder , when price 1259.00
It's good. But it doesn't grind everything so easily. You have to run the motor for a bit longer duration,say 1 minute more than your usual machine. But I think the money you give us worth the quality. It's not as expensive.
Lookin very good,tough and nice not only main unit but also all jars. In my product The unit not work propperlly....heating another issue....
i am satisfied with service and product quality.
Nice product, package was good,delivered on time..them amazon
Light weight superb design But delivery very poor
It also doesn't work 100% of the time...and we're not sure why.  When we fill it, it seems to work fairly well right after but it either does not have as many sprays as it is supposed to, or it isn't working very long.
Simply Says...it's good....
Quality wise the product is ok at this price but the only thing is that Amazon failed to keep it's word of providing the batteries (offer) that's why one star less.......
Everready cell not received in package....
Nice product, package was good,delivered on time..them amazon
A very nice product at a great price.Iam using it fro last 3 weeks still there is no issue
Worst product
I am a moderate/ Domestic user after using this product for almost a month, Its flawless, Excellent product good motor less sound .. I am a happy user
very bad. received damaged product
I got the mixer with big jar lead broken. Overall quality is average. Will Amazon replace the lid?
good for only small family
It's Very Bad Product.Jar Very small,only one jar With Handle,Other 2 jar's without Handle..
Good Mixer grinder but unfortunately one of pot blades was damaged. So I replaced it .Then brought another brand Mixer Grinder. Also Juicer Jar Is small but can be not issue for many peoples.
Jar fitting issue little bit, otherwise good.
I have a number of booklites, different vendors, different styles, some AC adapter, some straight battery, cheap to higher prices, and this one is the best, the brightest, the one I will most often use.  It is connected to adapter and kept near computerat all times.  I am careful with such items, don't expect any problems, most booklites are not meant to be manhandled.
its not working properly. Very bad experience
But one thing before grinding of turmeric it must be small pieces otherwise blades can be broken and damage the machine. Finally I will tell, it is a 5 star product in this price range. Only flaw is looking otherwise it's very fine product.
Great Product bought at great price. I was looking to buy this product since long but was looking for a good price. Was able to grab the deal for Rs 6709 and additional 5% from HDFC depit card was the cherry on the cake. Also got a set of microwave containers with the unit. Packing was good and delivery was spot on. Thanks Amazon...Overall great experience
Just grt, got in lightening deal wid 10 free batteries. !Only miss the handles of the jars else its silent than a bajaj s harsh motor.
Very bad performance. It did not work even for two minutes. Poor quality.
Product is made of low quality material and the product received was broken... It's not worth to buy at all
Just grt, got in lightening deal wid 10 free batteries. !Only miss the handles of the jars else its silent than a bajaj s harsh motor.
I bought this because a friend swears by the outdoor one made by same company. But it doesn't seem to be helping with my small indoor dogs.
Product build looks cheap like some local brand.
I need the container with maroon lid...two times when we ordered it came with red lid...so can I get maroon lid
Conclusion..this is strictly my opinion..Its very hard to find a CDMA mobile, mmx cg666 do not disappoint u
good for only small family
Had bought it for someone and she loved it.Is useful and good quality.

Didn't Get Started After Power Up And Very Cheap Product, Body, Jars, Blades, Even Power Cable is Cheaper. RETURNED
it came in original packing no other care to support . but it came good condition no breakage. it working smooth with low noise . I suggest to buy.
The product is having a crack on its body. I need another piece immediately
Mixer dete hai lekin free wali battery nikal ke fasate hai
It also doesn't work 100% of the time...and we're not sure why.  When we fill it, it seems to work fairly well right after but it either does not have as many sprays as it is supposed to, or it isn't working very long.
Looks awesome in your kitchen, a 750W motor performs great with all kind of grinding works. The jars and base built is great. Overall a great product to buy.
The seller was so friendly for solving my queries and product was awesome. thanks. Quality good, delivery on time , packing good.
Product is not good as shown ... finishing of juicer is not perfect ...body of juicer is dusted ..not like cleaned .. my openion not to buy.
I purchased 3 units and they work well for us.  I have 2 units in children's bedrooms on AC power and the 3rd in the kitchen on batteries for portability.  The sound is clear and set-up and use is very easy.  The best thing about these units is the VOX answer option.  I have this option turned on in the kid's room and they merely have to answer back when I talk to them first without having to push the "talk" button.  This is very handy when you are talking to a 3 yr. old that doesn't quite understand how to use this.  I attached a large, very thin magnet on the back of my kitchen unit and I keep it on my fridge; but can bring it with me to other parts of the house if necessary.  The only small annoying feature is every time the "talk" button is pressed, a beep occurs.  But the other features outweight that small annoyance for me.
Good Mixer grinder but unfortunately one of pot blades was damaged. So I replaced it .Then brought another brand Mixer Grinder. Also Juicer Jar Is small but can be not issue for many peoples.
Very good product working fine speed is high noise is OK good looking, container metal is good, but there is some problem of container locking vartical line of container locker should clear by company for this it is not locking properly, user can do it but it will do carefully otherwise it can be broken.
i absolutely love this product. my neighbor has four little yippers and my shepard/chow mix was antogonized by the yipping on our side of the fence. I hung the device on my side of the fence and the noise keeps the neighbors dog from picking "arguments" with my dog. all barking and fighting has ceased. all the surrounding neighbor as well as me can get a good nights sleep now.
It gives burning smell when operating..
The item was replaced twice. Both times the packaging was flimsy and the free batteries promised by the seller was missing. As a compensation Amazon provided gift card worth the value of the batteries. Mixer has been working well for about a month.
I am a moderate/ Domestic user after using this product for almost a month, Its flawless, Excellent product good motor less sound .. I am a happy user
Conclusion..this is strictly my opinion..Its very hard to find a CDMA mobile, mmx cg666 do not disappoint u
Nice product in Low price
product is nyc it is working properly.
Ridiculously loud, enough to cause your ears to ache, and doesn't grind efficiently. The screws holding the handles are on the inside of the jar, so you can't use a spatula efficiently, and scrubber fibers keep getting entangled.
This device does not work as it is supposed to. I've tried different batteries (brand new) and it doesn't seem to matter. The device has to be about three feet away from my dog for it to kick on and it doesn't work consistently so it is not effective for training a dog.
Received mixer but not free everready battery AA pack of 10? Received review .
Very very good product, I got it from amazon 29/01/2017 PRICE 1259.00, motor speed very high,fan speed very high, grind very well. This is the best buy for me, THANK YOU AMAZON. I need two another Eveready glowi mixer grinder , when price 1259.00
The product quality is worst very low quality materials are used. Very bad. Not satisfied with the product
Didn't Get Started After Power Up And Very Cheap Product, Body, Jars, Blades, Even Power Cable is Cheaper. RETURNED
Initially, my dogs found the sound interesting and slowed down on barking, but after a couple of days they acted like they didn't even hear the sound. Now, they are back to "bark all you want".
Blades of the Containers are not sufficient
worst product i got amazon. defective not working product given me.
Very nice product vry slowly voice it's amazing..
Conclusion..this is strictly my opinion..Its very hard to find a CDMA mobile, mmx cg666 do not disappoint u
Product was good but the wire connection is too small and there's no handles for 2 jars
It's good. But it doesn't grind everything so easily. You have to run the motor for a bit longer duration,say 1 minute more than your usual machine. But I think the money you give us worth the quality. It's not as expensive.
Its like ever ready .nice and best for house use.
Bought It To Gift My Aunt On Their Marriage Anniversary, But Very 1st Time Amazon And Cloudtail (Biggest Seller On Amazon) Disappoints Me.
I purchased 3 units and they work well for us.  I have 2 units in children's bedrooms on AC power and the 3rd in the kitchen on batteries for portability.  The sound is clear and set-up and use is very easy.  The best thing about these units is the VOX answer option.  I have this option turned on in the kid's room and they merely have to answer back when I talk to them first without having to push the "talk" button.  This is very handy when you are talking to a 3 yr. old that doesn't quite understand how to use this.

Worst product
This is a very useful Product. Highly Customer Friendly!!! Recommend to buy!!!
Very good item,it word well.Also the price is very very economical and powerful as this is 750 W mixie.Worth purchasing and supplied as per the specifications.
Battery not available only small jar is grinding. Big jar is not grinding. Asked for replacement.
noisy and jars leaking
This item is cheaply made and I sent it back.  The picture looks cool but it's deceiving.  The minute hand was so loose that when it was on the right side, it flopped down to the right and then when it was on the left, it plopped down to the left.  It couldn't keep the right time.
Working fine
i have been using last two week . it is great & working fine but i am in doubt that the grinder blade may be broken if i grinding the spices(KHARA MASALA) .
Good Mixer grinder but unfortunately one of pot blades was damaged. So I replaced it .Then brought another brand Mixer Grinder. Also Juicer Jar Is small but can be not issue for many peoples.
Very good product in this price range and wattage range. Bought six months ago .........working without any problem or complaint.
Speed regulator is not working properly, it's working only at highest speed, other speed functions are not working, I got defective peice
Yorkshire had to be standing within 3 feet before ultrasound was effective so dog just moved over a couple of feet to bark.
I was so excited to get this product and end my dog's barking. It worked a bit for the first few days or so, I think mostly because my dog was startled by it. But, as time went on, he got used to it and now it doesn't make any difference at all.
The blades are only 2 in every jar it's grinding work is less and The power of the Pigeon Torrent Mixer Grinder is specified 750W rating. But the actual motor fitted inside this mixer is very small and low power rated. It is not worth buying at Rs.1695/- cost. Item name is misleading the buyer.
Sometimes it sprays when she barks, most of the time it doesn't. So I would say its effectiveness has been rather low. It's not the battery or the fill level - maybe it just depends on the dog. I can bark into it myself and it sprays just fine. (My children found this amusing.
pros: Easy to grip on hand, ear piece sound clarity ok, nice look, good battery back up last around 5days, signal reception ok, over all its works smoothly and speedy compare to other phones around this price.
The product quality is worst very low quality materials are used. Very bad. Not satisfied with the product
its not working properly. Very bad experience
Mixer is good, but the small pot lid is very difficult to remove. And the lid shape is so bad that u will end up tearing your hand to remove the lid from pot.
Good. Product hai. Or. Budget. Me. Bhi. Aa jata hai. Or. 10. Battrey. Bhi. Free. Ati. Hai
i have been using last two week . it is great & working fine but i am in doubt that the grinder blade may be broken if i grinding the spices(KHARA MASALA) .
Both dry grinder & liquidising jar lids are not fitting in. Liquidising jar lid was too loose , looks like packaging person has put too dry grinding lids.
Good 750 watt motor and good design and with less price
Best Product,Best and Fair Price,Made by good quality of plastic and steel material, Heavy motor,Good Packaging. Buy Now. I personally recommended after 6 month of using.
Jar fitting issue little bit, otherwise good.
Blades of the Containers are not sufficient
It's so much heating .....Please stay alert All new customers who wants to buy​ this product
Best Product,Best and Fair Price,Made by good quality of plastic and steel material, Heavy motor,Good Packaging. Buy Now. I personally recommended after 6 month of using.
needed a mixer grinder for our new home and gave it a try..havent used much but the built quality seems ok..got few batteries as freebies..
Didn't Get Started After Power Up And Very Cheap Product, Body, Jars, Blades, Even Power Cable is Cheaper.
Cons: Ring tone volume is low, hard to hear on outside noisy conditions. Call and back buttons are integrated so that difficult to press call button alone. Tried mp3 to select as ringtone from memory card but failed, u cannot send contacts through Bluetooth.
I was so thrilled when I unpacked my processor.  It is  so high quality and professional in both looks and performance.  It has so many features that I love, especially the triple bowl which allows you to process more than one substance at a time.  The egg beater attachment is excellent also.  I am one happy customer and recommend this processor to all.
Its like ever ready .nice and best for house use.
Nic product at this price tag.. #i hve got it in 6 dayzz of order #working fine... #value of money.. #it is light weight#which izz quite suprising. #wt a 1 year warranty..
Concept is good, plastic can be better, lids are fairly air tight, high and colourful. Kurtzy is written across the side which I did not care for much. The packing was good and delivery was really fast. So enjoyment is guarantee. 1900ml can hold 1.2 kg of dal/rice and the 2500ml hold approximately 2.2 kgs.
I got the mixer with big jar lead broken. Overall quality is average. Will Amazon replace the lid?
product is good but it is not working more time, i use it. It is heat when we use 3-4 time a day & the courier takes more time for delivery
The product is having a crack on its body. I need another piece immediately
My mixer grinder us out of order since 12-15 days and yet Pigeon personnel are not getting it rectified. Everyday there is a new excuse for not attending to the issue. Even customer care hasn't kept its promise. Also the mixer went bad within 40 days of purchase. I got cheated.
we had to return as it is making lot of noise.. our 6 old preethi is still better than this and works well..

Having read the other reviews of this product on this site, I decided to go ahead and give these collars a shot despite some of the problems other reviewers had encountered.  I ordered three of these products from this site, and when they arrived, not a single one of them worked - at all.  They were completely useless and despite trying everything other reviewers and the manufacturer suggested, these products are completely useless.  Although I have contacted the manufacturer of this product about the defects, I would still like the buyer to be aware that if purchasing this product from this website, that if the product does not work, it can not be returned for a refund or even exchanged.

One good thing about this is the powerful motor. However the quality of the jar caps is not that great. You may have to replace after the constant use. Overall its a good product.

Small Jar not fitting properly on mixer, need to put hand and keep it pressed for using it. Mixer makes lots of noice however seems to do its job without any issue. .... Bill as well as warranty card has no mention of purchase date, warranty card not filled and stampted.

Very worst product. Bought just before 4 days, it stopped working. As it was gift to my sister.. I couldn't face them again because of this product.
Initially, my dogs found the sound interesting and slowed down on barking, but after a couple of days they acted like they didn't even hear the sound. Now, they are back to "bark all you want".

i have been using last two week . it is great & working fine but i am in doubt that the grinder blade may be broken if i grinding the spices(KHARA MASALA) .
No problem so far.It is value for money.
I've spent ten years and hundreds (and hundreds and hundreds!) of dollars collecting German steel.  Global is so good that it has me thinking of starting all over again.
The small jar got damaged on its first try. So don't ever take a chance.
Bad products
pros: Easy to grip on hand, ear piece sound clarity ok, nice look, good battery back up last around 5days, signal reception ok, over all its works smoothly and speedy compare to other phones around this price.

Nice product in Low price
i have been using last two week . it is great & working fine but i am in doubt that the grinder blade may be broken if i grinding the spices(KHARA MASALA) .
The blades of mixer are not sharp I am very disappointed with the product The free batteries did not come with grinder
The steel jar cracked in 8 days of use. The steel is of very low quality. Never expected from a brand like preethi and Amazon.
Very worst product. Bought just before 4 days, it stopped working. As it was gift to my sister.. I couldn't face them again because of this product.
it came in original packing no other care to support . but it came good condition no breakage. it working smooth with low noise . I suggest to buy.
The product is having a crack on its body. I need another piece immediately
Small jar is slightly broken
Awesome product... I recommend it..
A very good product in budget...
Good quality product. revived product expected delivery. Thanks.
Jar fitting issue little bit, otherwise good.
Good product at low cost
Product is good but battery not received.
Nice product in Low price
This item is cheaply made and I sent it back.  The picture looks cool but it's deceiving.  The minute hand was so loose that when it was on the right side, it flopped down to the right and then when it was on the left, it plopped down to the left.  It couldn't keep the right time.
The blades are only 2 in every jar it's grinding work is less and The power of the Pigeon Torrent Mixer Grinder is specified 750W rating. But the actual motor fitted inside this mixer is very small and low power rated. It is not worth buying at Rs.1695/- cost. Item name is misleading the buyer.
This product is ok but it will get hot sooner..
RETURNED
Product build looks cheap like some local brand.
My mixer grinder us out of order since 12-15 days and yet Pigeon personnel are not getting it rectified. Everyday there is a new excuse for not attending to the issue. Even customer care hasn't kept its promise. Also the mixer went bad within 40 days of purchase. I got cheated.
I personally used this product and my suggestion is don't run it long time, less than 1 minute is enough and cool the machine for 5 minutes then you can run next, 4 times if you can do like this your machine will be run for long time and your dry grinding items will be powder.Don't the machine over load, half portion of container material is ok.
after few days, it sounds like old car engine!!!
Very good product I got from Amazon...
Good Mixer grinder but unfortunately one of pot blades was damaged. So I replaced it .Then brought another brand Mixer Grinder. Also Juicer Jar Is small but can be not issue for many peoples.
The small jar got damaged on its first try. So don't ever take a chance.
Excellent works fine Only problem is Lid comes off on need a lock..
RETURNED
A very nice product at a great price.Iam using it fro last 3 weeks still there is no issue
I was so thrilled when I unpacked my processor.  It is  so high quality and professional in both looks and performance.  It has so many features that I love, especially the triple bowl which allows you to process more than one substance at a time.  The egg beater attachment is excellent also.  I am one happy customer and recommend this processor to all.
I purchased 3 units and they work well for us.  I have 2 units in children's bedrooms on AC power and the 3rd in the kitchen on batteries for portability.  The sound is clear and set-up and use is very easy.  The best thing about these units is the VOX answer option.  I have this option turned on in the kid's room and they merely have to answer back when I talk to them first without having to push the "talk" button.  This is very handy when you are talking to a 3 yr. old that doesn't quite understand how to use this.  I attached a large, very thin magnet on the back of my kitchen unit and I keep it on my fridge; but can bring it with me to other parts of the house if necessary.  The only small annoying feature is every time the "talk" button is pressed, a beep occurs.  But the other features outweight that small annoyance for me.
Looks awesome in your kitchen, a 750W motor performs great with all kind of grinding works. The jars and base built is great. Overall a great product to buy.
I've always wanted a deep fryer, and finally decided to take the plunge.  After doing quite a bit of research, I decided on this model - picked one up at Bed, Bath, and Beyond with a 20% coupon.  In my opinion, you generally get what you pay for - so the extra cost vs. competitors wasn't a real concern.
Please don't buy this, stopped working in the third week itself.

Looks awesome in your kitchen, a 750W motor performs great with all kind of grinding works. The jars and base built is great. Overall a great product to buy.
Very good item,it word well.Also the price is very very economical and powerful as this is 750 W mixie.Worth purchasing and supplied as per the specifications.
Blades of the Containers are not sufficient
Product was good but the wire connection is too small and there's no handles for 2 jars
Excellent works fine Only problem is Lid comes off on need a lock...
I have Zen m81 using with tata indica, which is a totally argent phone, fail to receive signal and can't speak smoothly..m81 have worst earpiece sounds..so that I changed the model to mmx cg666
Very good product I got from Amazon...
This is a very useful Product. Highly Customer Friendly!!! Recommend to buy!!!
Pros- Good quality materials High rpm(21000) 5 year warranty on motor Lifetime free service (as mentioned on the leaflet) Cons- Jars make noise Wire is small as compared to the over old mixer There is no Authorised service centre in rajasthan
This item is cheaply made and I sent it back.  The picture looks cool but it's deceiving.  The minute hand was so loose that when it was on the right side, it flopped down to the right and then when it was on the left, it plopped down to the left.  It couldn't keep the right time.
Nice at price of 1300 rs
Product is good but battery not received.
It gives burning smell when operating..
Five stars Because the product arrived was really nice... Price satisfying product... Worth the money... No defect identified...
Good product with in budget price.
It's Very Bad Product.Jar Very small,only one jar With Handle,Other 2 jar's without Handle..
Its a waste item .don't buy anybody
its not working properly. Very bad experience
i absolutely love this product. my neighbor has four little yippers and my shepard/chow mix was antogonized by the yipping on our side of the fence. I hung the device on my side of the fence and the noise keeps the neighbors dog from picking "arguments" with my dog. all barking and fighting has ceased. all the surrounding neighbor as well as me can get a good nights sleep now.
Sometimes it sprays when she barks, most of the time it doesn't. So I would say its effectiveness has been rather low. It's not the battery or the fill level - maybe it just depends on the dog. I can bark into it myself and it sprays just fine. (My children found this amusing.
It's good. But it doesn't grind everything so easily. You have to run the motor for a bit longer duration,say 1 minute more than your usual machine. But I think the money you give us worth the quality. It's not as expensive.
Very good product in this price range and wattage range. Bought six months ago .........working without any problem or complaint.
The blades of mixer are not sharp I am very disappointed with the product The free batteries did not come with grinder
good for only small family
product is good but it is not working more time, i use it. It is heat when we use 3-4 time a day & the courier takes more time for delivery
Good Mixer grinder but unfortunately one of pot blades was damaged. So I replaced it .Then brought another brand Mixer Grinder. Also Juicer Jar Is small but can be not issue for many peoples.

it came in original packing no other care to support . but it came good condition no breakage. it working smooth with low noise . I suggest to buy.
Good Product from the company, it seems like they have take a generic product and just paste eveready on it. Very sturdy and useful. However, the Jars does not fit properly in the machine. I modified the locks and now it is fine. You cannot ask more in 1200 bucks. My wife is fine with it, therefore, I am super fine.
It is truly a junk sold as a mixer after 3 days there was smoke coming out of the mixer and quite hazardous for children to be around. Pathetic service by amazon for felicitating junk to be sold & robbing customers.
Good 750 watt motor and good design and with less price
good for only small family

Lookin very good,tough and nice not only main unit but also all jars. In my product The unit not work propperlly....heating another issue....
Worth of money....good
Easy to use, easy to clean. Two major requirements for a kitchen appliance for me to be happy. This thing is easier to clean than my old George Foreman Grill (and that to me was a pain in the neck). The only time it can be a little messy is when you change the oil, which I do every 2 to 3 weeks depending on how much I've used it and what I've cooked. If I am doing just veggies, I keep the oil. If I do a meat or seafood, I'll change the oil right after.
Nice product with this price tag with 2 years warranty. but i had returned it. because i am looking for a juicer mixer grinder.
But one thing before grinding of turmeric it must be small pieces otherwise blades can be broken and damage the machine. Finally I will tell, it is a 5 star product in this price range. Only flaw is looking otherwise it's very fine product.
noisy and jars leaking
Best Product,Best and Fair Price,Made by good quality of plastic and steel material, Heavy motor,Good Packaging. Buy Now. I personally recommended after 6 month of using.
Nic product at this price tag.. #i hve got it in 6 dayzz of order #working fine... #value of money.. #it is light weight#which izz quite suprising. #wt a 1 year warranty..

I was so excited to get this product and end my dog's barking. It worked a bit for the first few days or so, I think mostly because my dog was startled by it. But, as time went on, he got used to it and now it doesn't make any difference at all.
it came in original packing no other care to support . but it came good condition no breakage. it working smooth with low noise . I suggest to buy.
Till now product has worked ok and i hope it works like that in coming days also. Quiet fast and really quiet as compared to Sumeet we had earlier.
If you use it in rare case like a bachelor cooking then it's fine. But there are few issues like you have to hold the cap of the jar while grinding and the jar will turn and come up automatically of you won't hold it tight.
Very bad performance. It did not work even for two minutes. Poor quality.
The product is having a crack on its body. I need another piece immediately
Ridiculously loud, enough to cause your ears to ache, and doesn't grind efficiently. The screws holding the handles are on the inside of the jar, so you can't use a spatula efficiently, and scrubber fibers keep getting entangled.
Very very good product, I got it from amazon 29/01/2017 PRICE 1259.00, motor speed very high,fan speed very high, grind very well. This is the best buy for me, THANK YOU AMAZON. I need two another Eveready glowi mixer grinder , when price 1259.00
it came in original packing no other care to support . but it came good condition no breakage. it working smooth with low noise . I suggest to buy.
Good one but i got red color..expected purple.. Duplicate of Tupperware! Very bad quality it was broken from inside when i recieved it.. We cannot ordered above 100 CD or DVD.
Bought it, set it up, my dogs bark just as bad, doesn't faze them at all. Waste of money, don't buy
Received mixer but not free everready battery AA pack of 10? Received review .

Nice product. Using past 2 months. No issues. Happy with the product. Value for money. Go for it.. .. ..
Yorkshire had to be standing within 3 feet before ultrasound was effective so dog just moved over a couple of feet to bark.
Working fine
Quality wise the product is ok at this price but the only thing is that Amazon failed to keep it's word of providing the batteries (offer) that's why one star less.......
Excellent product on this price.
worst product i got amazon. defective not working product given me.
Good product They are given delivery on promised time.. Product quality is good
Worst product
Good one but i got red color..expected purple.. Duplicate of Tupperware! Very bad quality it was broken from inside when i recieved it.. We cannot ordered above 100 CD or DVD.
only received the microwave oven but didn't receive the utensils which attached with every microwaves generally..
product is okay.....but finishing not good. black gum patches everywhere in jars....okay at this price
Five stars Because the product arrived was really nice... Price satisfying product... Worth the money... No defect identified...
The steel jar cracked in 8 days of use. The steel is of very low quality. Never expected from a brand like preethi and Amazon.
I bought this because a friend swears by the outdoor one made by same company. But it doesn't seem to be helping with my small indoor dogs.
i am satisfied with service and product quality.
Good product They are given delivery on promised time.. Product quality is good
It is a good product at this price but jar size could be bigger.n the steel in not good quality.
Excellent works fine Only problem is Lid comes off on need a lock..

Small Jar not fitting properly on mixer, need to put hand and keep it pressed for using it. Mixer makes lots of noice however seems to do its job without any issue. .... Bill as well as warranty card has no mention of purchase date, warranty card not filled and stampted.
Awesome product... I recommend it..
Lid is not getting close properly. Size is too small than what appears in the picture.
quality of steel is decent. But the size of two small jars is too less than normal size jar sizes should have been made this a perfect mixer set

The product quality is worst very low quality materials are used. Very bad. Not satisfied with the product
We have a six month old pit/lab/heeler mix. The first time he barked after this was turned on, he noticed "something" ... but this hasn't kept him from barking at ALL. I was really hoping it would.

It also doesn't work 100% of the time...and we're not sure why.  When we fill it, it seems to work fairly well right after but it either does not have as many sprays as it is supposed to, or it isn't working very long.

Having read the other reviews of this product on this site, I decided to go ahead and give these collars a shot despite some of the problems other reviewers had encountered.  I ordered three of these products from this site, and when they arrived, not a single one of them worked - at all.  They were completely useless and despite trying everything other reviewers and the manufacturer suggested, these products are completely useless.  Although I have contacted the manufacturer of this product about the defects, I would still like the buyer to be aware that if purchasing this product from this website, that if the product does not work, it can not be returned for a refund or even exchanged.  Thus, your credit card will still be billed, your dogs will still be barking, and you may get stuck with products that are worthless. 
I've spent ten years and hundreds (and hundreds and hundreds!) of dollars collecting German steel.  Global is so good that it has me thinking of starting all over again.
Sometimes it sprays when she barks, most of the time it doesn't. So I would say its effectiveness has been rather low. It's not the battery or the fill level - maybe it just depends on the dog. I can bark into it myself and it sprays just fine. (My children found this amusing.
I have a number of booklites, different vendors, different styles, some AC adapter, some straight battery, cheap to higher prices, and this one is the best, the brightest, the one I will most often use.  It is connected to adapter and kept near computerat all times.  I am careful with such items, don't expect any problems, most booklites are not meant to be manhandled.
This item is cheaply made and I sent it back.  The picture looks cool but it's deceiving.  The minute hand was so loose that when it was on the right side, it flopped down to the right and then when it was on the left, it plopped down to the left.  It couldn't keep the right time.

I am one happy customer and recommend this processor to all.
Initially, my dogs found the sound interesting and slowed down on barking, but after a couple of days they acted like they didn't even hear the sound. Now, they are back to "bark all you want".
This device does not work as it is supposed to. I've tried different batteries (brand new) and it doesn't seem to matter. The device has to be about three feet away from my dog for it to kick on and it doesn't work consistently so it is not effective for training a dog.
I bought this because a friend swears by the outdoor one made by same company. But it doesn't seem to be helping with my small indoor dogs.
I was really looking forward to receive this product. My dog is a small one - 12 pounds - 3 years old. Her only flaw is that when someone rings the intercom she goes crazy barking. I purchased this item because I researched it - I expected it to work. It didn't - it does light when she barks, I even point it at her and press the button, she stops for one second then back to the same old, even if I continually point and press it.
Lid is not getting close properly. Size is too small than what appears in the picture. 
The seller was so friendly for solving my queries and product was awesome. thanks. Quality good, delivery on time , packing good.

Concept is good, plastic can be better, lids are fairly air tight, high and colourful. Kurtzy is written across the side which I did not care for much. The packing was good and delivery was really fast. So enjoyment is guarantee. 1900ml can hold 1.2 kg of dal/rice and the 2500ml hold approximately 2.2 kgs.

Although I have contacted the manufacturer of this product about the defects, I would still like the buyer to be aware that if purchasing this product from this website, that if the product does not work, it can not be returned for a refund or even exchanged.  Thus, your credit card will still be billed, your dogs will still be barking, and you may get stuck with products that are worthless. 
I've spent ten years and hundreds (and hundreds and hundreds!) of dollars collecting German steel.  Global is so good that it has me thinking of starting all over again.
Sometimes it sprays when she barks, most of the time it doesn't. So I would say its effectiveness has been rather low. It's not the battery or the fill level - maybe it just depends on the dog. I can bark into it myself and it sprays just fine. (My children found this amusing.
I have a number of booklites, different vendors, different styles, some AC adapter, some straight battery, cheap to higher prices, and this one is the best, the brightest, the one I will most often use.  It is connected to adapter and kept near computerat all times.  I am careful with such items, don't expect any problems, most booklites are not meant to be manhandled.
This item is cheaply made and I sent it back.  The picture looks cool but it's deceiving.  The minute hand was so loose that when it was on the right side, it flopped down to the right and then when it was on the left, it plopped down to the left.  It couldn't keep the right time.
I was so thrilled when I unpacked my processor.  It is  so high quality and professional in both looks and performance.  It has so many features that I love, especially the triple bowl which allows you to process more than one substance at a time.  The egg beater attachment is excellent also.  I am one happy customer and recommend this processor to all.
Initially, my dogs found the sound interesting and slowed down on barking, but after a couple of days they acted like they didn't even hear the sound. Now, they are back to "bark all you want".
Got it well before the estimated delivery date. Packaging was ok. Got free starter kit and recipe booklet. Waiting for demo and first time cooking experience. 
No problem so far.It is value for money. 
Great Product bought at great price. I was looking to buy this product since long but was looking for a good price. Was able to grab the deal for Rs 6709 and additional 5% from HDFC depit card was the cherry on the cake. Also got a set of microwave containers with the unit. Packing was good and delivery was spot on. Thanks Amazon...Overall great experience 
only received the microwave oven but didn't receive the utensils which attached with every microwaves generally.. 
It's good. But it doesn't grind everything so easily. You have to run the motor for a bit longer duration,say 1 minute more than your usual machine. But I think the money you give us worth the quality. It's not as expensive.
Very very good product, I got it from amazon 29/01/2017 PRICE 1259.00, motor speed very high,fan speed very high, grind very well. This is the best buy for me, THANK YOU AMAZON. I need two another Eveready glowi mixer grinder , when price 1259.00 
Nice product with this price tag with 2 years warranty. but i had returned it. because i am looking for a juicer mixer grinder.
Good Mixer grinder but unfortunately one of pot blades was damaged. So I replaced it .Then brought another brand Mixer Grinder. Also Juicer Jar Is small but can be not issue for many peoples.

It is a good product at this price but jar size could be bigger.n the steel in not good quality.
I have not received 10 pcs Battery with the pack.
Speed regulator is not working properly, it's working only at highest speed, other speed functions are not working, I got defective peice
Good quality. Blending is fine.
Good product in this price.very cheap and working fine.delivery is very fast thank you Amzon.
Product was good but the wire connection is too small and there's no handles for 2 jars
Good Mixer grinder but unfortunately one of pot blades was damaged. So I replaced it .Then brought another brand Mixer Grinder. Also Juicer Jar Is small but can be not issue for many peoples.
i think these products are refurbished. never had such an experience with amazon.First order the jar teeth was broken. ordered a replacement....it had scratches on the main unit and lid of one of the jars was cracked...disappointed...
Very worst product. Bought just before 4 days, it stopped working. As it was gift to my sister.. I couldn't face them again because of this product.
Hi , the product is covered under 2 years of warranty. you can call this number - 18001024041 , and a technician will visit and find a solution, the company can even change the product if the problem persists. Has happened with me. therefore sharing my experience with you.
worst product i got amazon. defective not working product given me.
My mom is very happy so I can say this..this product is awesome :) thanks amazon
Awesome product in low budget
Very good product working fine speed is high noise is OK good looking, container metal is good, but there is some problem of container locking vartical line of container locker should clear by company for this it is not locking properly, user can do it but it will do carefully otherwise it can be broken. 
I personally used this product and my suggestion is don't run it long time, less than 1 minute is enough and cool the machine for 5 minutes then you can run next, 4 times if you can do like this your machine will be run for long time and your dry grinding items will be powder.Don't the machine over load, half portion of container material is ok. 
But one thing before grinding of turmeric it must be small pieces otherwise blades can be broken and damage the machine. Finally I will tell, it is a 5 star product in this price range. Only flaw is looking otherwise it's very fine product.
Just grt, got in lightening deal wid 10 free batteries. !Only miss the handles of the jars else its silent than a bajaj s harsh motor.
Please don't buy this, stopped working in the third week itself.
The blades of mixer are not sharp I am very disappointed with the product The free batteries did not come with grinder
The item is very compact and space saver as well as useful for all the occasions.
Battery not available only small jar is grinding. Big jar is not grinding. Asked for replacement.
Good quality product. revived product expected delivery. Thanks.
I am not say something this product because today I had received a damage product
Its like ever ready .nice and best for house use.
Good. Product hai. Or. Budget. Me. Bhi. Aa jata hai. Or. 10. Battrey. Bhi. Free. Ati. Hai
Nice at price of 1300 rs
Light weight superb design But delivery very poor
Very good product I got from Amazon...
A very good product in budget...
Product build looks cheap like some local brand.
Both dry grinder & liquidising jar lids are not fitting in. Liquidising jar lid was too loose , looks like packaging person has put too dry grinding lids.
It's good working....
The small jar got damaged on its first try. So don't ever take a chance.
Jar fitting issue little bit, otherwise good.
The item was replaced twice. Both times the packaging was flimsy and the free batteries promised by the seller was missing. As a compensation Amazon provided gift card worth the value of the batteries. Mixer has been working well for about a month.
Quality of blade is very poor. Blade of one jar broken.
product is good but it is not working more time, i use it. It is heat when we use 3-4 time a day & the courier takes more time for delivery
Everready cell not received in package....
Received mixer but not free everready battery AA pack of 10? Received review .
its not working properly. Very bad experience
I am not received 10 pcs Battery with the pack.
Worth of money....good
Very very good product, I got it from amazon 29/01/2017 PRICE 1259.00, motor speed very high,fan speed very high, grind very well. This is the best buy for me, THANK YOU AMAZON. I need two another Eveready glowi mixer grinder , when price 1259.00
Quality wise the product is ok at this price but the only thing is that Amazon failed to keep it's word of providing the batteries (offer) that's why one star less.......
Though the 10 batteries set is free with mixi...all the batteries were removed from package, damaged and not looked like new batteries. Then what is the use of free batteries with the product
Very nice product in this price.
Good product at low cost
Lookin very good,tough and nice not only main unit but also all jars. In my product The unit not work propperlly....heating another issue....
Something is not working how is it service
Good Product from the company, it seems like they have take a generic product and just paste eveready on it. Very sturdy and useful. However, the Jars does not fit properly in the machine. I modified the locks and now it is fine. You cannot ask more in 1200 bucks. My wife is fine with it, therefore, I am super fine.
That is a Verry verry Good items it's worked verry good.
i am satisfied with service and product quality.
I have purchased it around 1300 and it's been 2 months after using it Iam writing this review. I think this is the Best Buy I got at the price, it is working excellent till now. This mixer is quite better compared to other high range products.
noisy and jars leaking
Mixer dete hai lekin free wali battery nikal ke fasate hai
Serves the purpose absolutely. You may feel the build quality is a bit poor, but that doesn't affect the performance, which is quite good. If you're not too keen on aesthetics of the appliance, you can blindly go for this one. I have so far used it for making shakes, chutney, grinding spices n blending, mincing meat and wasn't disappointed at all.
Small Jar not fitting properly on mixer, need to put hand and keep it pressed for using it. Mixer makes lots of noice however seems to do its job without any issue. .... Bill as well as warranty card has no mention of purchase date, warranty card not filled and stampted.
Product is not good as shown ... finishing of juicer is not perfect ...body of juicer is dusted ..not like cleaned .. my openion not to buy.
It is good at this price . Thanks a lot to the amazon .
good for only small family
Excellent works fine Only problem is Lid comes off on need a lock...
It's so much heating .....Please stay alert All new customers who wants to buy​ this product
very bad. received damaged product 
After returning also I have received damage product. 
Nic product at this price tag.. #i hve got it in 6 dayzz of order #working fine... #value of money.. #it is light weight#which izz quite suprising. #wt a 1 year warranty.. 
Very good product in this price range and wattage range. Bought six months ago .........working without any problem or complaint.
Looks awesome in your kitchen, a 750W motor performs great with all kind of grinding works. The jars and base built is great. Overall a great product to buy. 
This product is too much noisey. Cannot tolret 1 min.. going to return this product. I suggest to all user don't buy this product.
The performance of the product was good but the plastic is waste quality the I mixer which I received had a crack on the base. It was urgent for me so I unscrewed the base and feviquick it.
I got the mixer with big jar lead broken. Overall quality is average. Will Amazon replace the lid?
product is nyc it is working properly.
Very useful
Very good product in this price range and wattage range. Bought six months ago .........working without any problem or complaint.
It is truly a junk sold as a mixer after 3 days there was smoke coming out of the mixer and quite hazardous for children to be around. Pathetic service by amazon for felicitating junk to be sold & robbing customers.
A very nice product at a great price.Iam using it fro last 3 weeks still there is no issue
It's so much heating .....Please stay alert All new customers who wants to buy​ this product
The product is having a crack on its body. I need another piece immediately
Blades of the Containers are not sufficient
good, no noise motor, and the grinder is excellent
It gives burning smell when operating..
The product quality is worst very low quality materials are used. Very bad. Not satisfied with the product
Excellent Working I saw many mixer grinder but during grinding some pastes and rice items with grinder i did not feel any vibrates smoothly works packing was good as always Thank You Amazon For A amazing Deal
My mixer grinder us out of order since 12-15 days and yet Pigeon personnel are not getting it rectified. Everyday there is a new excuse for not attending to the issue. Even customer care hasn't kept its promise. Also the mixer went bad within 40 days of purchase. I got cheated.
Product not upto the mark,but compare to price its ok.
If you use it in rare case like a bachelor cooking then it's fine. But there are few issues like you have to hold the cap of the jar while grinding and the jar will turn and come up automatically of you won't hold it tight.
Best Product,Best and Fair Price,Made by good quality of plastic and steel material, Heavy motor,Good Packaging. Buy Now. I personally recommended after 6 month of using.
Its a waste item .don't buy anybody
One good thing about this is the powerful motor. However the quality of the jar caps is not that great. You may have to replace after the constant use. Overall its a good product.
The product is looking very nice. Working perfectly.jars are not to good only 2 blades are there but is ok.jars have a heavy plastic material's lids. Very nice product. Thank u Amazone...
This is a very useful Product. Highly Customer Friendly!!! Recommend to buy!!!
Excellent works fine Only problem is Lid comes off on need a lock..
Very bad performance. It did not work even for two minutes. Poor quality.
Happy buying it,, Price worthy.
Works as it should. Product is lighter than expected!
The mixie stopped working after using it for two times, the wire had to be replaced
Good product They are given delivery on promised time.. Product quality is good
The blades are only 2 in every jar it's grinding work is less and The power of the Pigeon Torrent Mixer Grinder is specified 750W rating. But the actual motor fitted inside this mixer is very small and low power rated. It is not worth buying at Rs.1695/- cost. Item name is misleading the buyer.

I have Zen m81 using with tata indica, which is a totally argent phone, fail to receive signal and can't speak smoothly..m81 have worst earpiece sounds..so that I changed the model to mmx cg666
pros: Easy to grip on hand, ear piece sound clarity ok, nice look, good battery back up last around 5days, signal reception ok, over all its works smoothly and speedy compare to other phones around this price.
Cons: Ring tone volume is low, hard to hear on outside noisy conditions. Call and back buttons are integrated so that difficult to press call button alone. Tried mp3 to select as ringtone from memory card but failed, u cannot send contacts through Bluetooth.
Conclusion..this is strictly my opinion..Its very hard to find a CDMA mobile, mmx cg666 do not disappoint u
Very good item,it word well.Also the price is very very economical and powerful as this is 750 W mixie.Worth purchasing and supplied as per the specifications.
Good product no damages nice packing... Low price good quality...
750 watt motor is best but in jars atleast one jar have 4 cutting blades
Had bought it for someone and she loved it.Is useful and good quality.
Product is made of low quality material and the product received was broken... It's not worth to buy at all
Good 750 watt motor and good design and with less price
product is okay.....but finishing not good. black gum patches everywhere in jars....okay at this price
The steel jar cracked in 8 days of use. The steel is of very low quality. Never expected from a brand like preethi and Amazon.
we had to return as it is making lot of noise.. our 6 old preethi is still better than this and works well..
it came in original packing no other care to support . but it came good condition no breakage. it working smooth with low noise . I suggest to buy.
Ridiculously loud, enough to cause your ears to ache, and doesn't grind efficiently. The screws holding the handles are on the inside of the jar, so you can't use a spatula efficiently, and scrubber fibers keep getting entangled.
Till now product has worked ok and i hope it works like that in coming days also. Quiet fast and really quiet as compared to Sumeet we had earlier.
Pros- Good quality materials High rpm(21000) 5 year warranty on motor Lifetime free service (as mentioned on the leaflet) Cons- Jars make noise Wire is small as compared to the over old mixer There is no Authorised service centre in rajasthan
quality of steel is decent. But the size of two small jars is too less than normal size jar sizes should have been made this a perfect mixer set
Mixer is good, but the small pot lid is very difficult to remove. And the lid shape is so bad that u will end up tearing your hand to remove the lid from pot.
Quite good. Noise is same as other Mixer Grinder. Could register online for warranty.
